Walkthrough

- Head to Ru'Lude Gardens and speak with Pherimociel at (G-6) in the
  palace for a cutscene which begins this mission.
- You must now complete each of the three Promyvions, which can be done
  in any order.
  - The walkthrough for completing each Promyvion is located in the next
    mission, The Mothercrystals.
- (Optional) Speak with Rainhard, Ru'Lude Gardens (H-6), at the top of
  the stairs in the palace for some dialogue about Harith.
- (Optional) Speak with Harith in the Duke's house (H-5) to learn a
  little more (very little) about the Emptiness.

Notes

You are now able to enter any of the three Promyvion areas. They are
accessed by examining the Shattered Telepoint at the crags in Konschtat
Highlands (Promyvion - Dem), Tahrongi Canyon (Promyvion - Mea), and La
Theine Plateau (Promyvion - Holla).
After examining the Shattered Telepoint and entering the Hall of
Transference, click on the Large Apparatus to your left to enter
Promyvion if this is your first time here. If not, you can enter via the
Cermet gate in the center.

- The three Promyvions can be completed in any order.

Some monsters inside Promyvion will drop an item called a \"Recollection
of...\" These items can be traded to Harith in Ru'Lude Gardens at (H-5)
along with 2,000 gil to receive an Anima. Which can be used to weaken
the bosses inside Promyvion if you do them at lower levels as the fights
were originally for a party of level 30 players. You may wish to try to
obtain a few animas before attempting the bosses, although it is
completely optional.

- Just remember not to erase your memory at the Large Apparatus before
  returning to Harith.

The goal of this mission is to reach the Spire found at the end of each
of the 3 Promyvion zones and defeat all 3 of the bosses in the \"Ancient
Flames Beckon\" battlefields. Defeating each boss gives a key item. Once
you have all 3 key items the mission is completed, and the next mission
starts.

''With the lifting of the level cap in Promathia areas, this quest is
now relatively trivial in difficulty. The walkthrough below was written
for a level cap of 30. However, be aware that there are new, high-level
Apex enemies ranging from level 139 to 142 in these areas, but they may
be avoided since they are not placed on main paths.
Trusts may be called through the entire climb and Spire fight, making it
possible to solo this at 40 or even earlier.

- Do make sure to avoid any Apex Mobs as those will aggro with True
  Sound detection and require multiple endgame players to fight.''

Note: Your mission log won't change to \"The Mothercrystals\" until
clearing one of the Promyvion areas. Since the walkthrough for all 3
Promyvions are similar, they are all included in this section.

| - Click on the Shattered Telepoint to enter the Hall of Transference |
| - Once inside, head to your left and click on the Large Apparatus to |
|   enter Promyvion.                                                   |
|                                                                      |
| There are 4 levels inside Promyvion, each with increasing            |
| difficulty. In order to reach the next floor, you must locate and    |
| defeat a Memory Receptacle. Some floors have more than one           |
| receptacle but only one of them hides the portal to the next floor.  |
| Widescan is useful for finding them.                                 |
|                                                                      |
| Sneak and Invisible are useless here as all the monsters are True    |
| Sight and/or True Sound.                                             |
|                                                                      |
| - Before fighting the receptacle, clear as many of the Strays as you |
|   can.                                                               |
|   - They are very weak and go down fast but they can be bothersome   |
|     if a whole group of them gangs up on a mage.                     |
|   - The Receptacle will continue to spawn Strays throughout the      |
|     fight, but they are easy to manage one at a time.                |
| - The Memory Receptacle does a rather obnoxious move called Empty    |
|   Seed that does some minor damage along with a huge knockback.      |
|   - Melee and tanks may wish to stand inside the platform next to    |
|     the receptacle with their backs against one of the pillars.      |
| - After defeating the receptacle, the Memory stream may appear to    |
|   allow you to progress to the next floor. If it doesn't, move on to |
|   another Memory Receptacle and try again.                           |
|   - If the Memory Stream does appear, kill any remaining strays      |
|     (important!) and move to the next floor.                         |
|   - It should be noted that if you wish to move down a floor (i.e.   |
|     to rescue someone) you will need to find an empty platform       |
|     similar to the one the Memory Receptacles are on. The portal     |
|     there will take you down one floor.                              |
| - When you reach the 4th floor, there are no more receptacles.       |
|   - The monsters on this floor can be very difficult so try your     |
|     best to avoid aggro and stay together.                           |
|   - The zone to the spires are:                                      |
|     - (H-8) for Dem (southwest of where you appear)                  |
|     - (K-8) for Holla (straight north, around a large hole)          |
|     - (I-6) for Mea (southeast of where you appear).                 |
|   - The entrance to the spire is a regular zone line so any mobs     |
|     chasing you can be zoned just like in any other area.            |
| - Use this time to go over strategies, make macros, prepare for the  |
|   boss, use the bathroom, whatever you need to do.                   |
| - When you are all ready, click on the Web of Recollections. The     |
|   name of the battlefield is \"Ancient Flames Beckon\".                |
|   - Some people may have started the ENM quest and be offered        |
|     another choice of battlefield but make sure everyone goes into   |
|     the right one.                                                   |
|   - All buffs except food will wear off when you enter so don't      |
|     waste your Reraise charges outside!                              |

Boss fights

- After defeating each boss once, you will be awarded with ( Light of
  Dem, Light of Holla and Light of Mea) and be transported out to the
  area in which you entered. The exception is after defeating the third
  Promyvion, you will appear at (K-9) in Lufaise Meadows and begin
  Chapter 2.
- If you plan on using animas, create an order to use them on the boss.
  They each last for 30 seconds and the effect do not stack.

Plot Details

- Tavnazia
  - The sister city of San d'Oria, seen in the opening movie, founded as
    a vassal state by General Alphollon Tajeux (later named Alphollon I
    Tavnazia) in 385 C.E. (Crystal Era), about 500 years ago.
  - 20 years ago, there was a massive tectonic shift that caused
    Tavnazia to break away from the mainland, turning it into an
    archipelago. This shift also created a mountain range in the Vollbow
    region of southern Quon.
  - Some survivors had been able to escape aboard merchant vessels
    before the destruction, such as Jakoh Wahcondalo and Aldo, who ended
    up in Norg, a city founded by Tavnazian refugees.
  - Justinius and Quelveuiat wear the new-to-CoP Barone Corazza armor
    set. This armor originating in the Near East was used by the
    Tavnazian Knights. The quality of goldsmithing used in this
    luxurious equipment's intricate patterns reflects the former
    prosperity of the lost nation.

Walkthrough

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| - Check the Sewer entrance in Tavnazian Safehold to enter Phomiuna   |
|   Aqueducts.                                                         |
| - In this area, you have two objectives to complete.                 |
|                                                                      |
| Objective 1                                                          |
|                                                                      |
| - Sneak and Invisible up and make your way toward (J-2) on the       |
|   second map where the Minotaur is.                                  |
|   - You must enter map 2 from point \"A\" on Map 1. Point \"B\" will not |
|     work.                                                            |
|     - So proceed to (F-4) Map 1 where it then becomes (F-10) Map 2   |
|       and fall. Head north afterwards.                               |
|   - On Map 2, take the wooden ladder up at (I-6), and then drop at   |
|     (K-5).                                                           |
|   - Taurus mobs have True Sight so you will just need to run behind  |
|     them or wait for them to move as their field of vision is very   |
|     narrow. Alternatively, one person can travel to the Minotaur     |
|     since it will draw the entire alliance in when one person aggros |
|     it.                                                              |
|     - Note: the Minotaur will NOT aggro a level 99 character, so     |
|       using the draw-in method will not work if you get aggro from a |
|       level 99 character.                                            |
|     - The Taurus (level 37-38) and Stegotaur (level 44-48) in this   |
|       zone can drop (1 is needed for a side-quest).                  |
|   - The Minotaur will use a move called Mortal Ray that inflicts     |
|     Doom on whoever is standing directly in front of it and facing   |
|     it. This means the tanks. It can usually be avoided by turning   |
|     your back but you need to be fast. If you do get doomed, Holy    |
|     Water and Cursna have a small chance to remove the effect. You   |
|     will probably need to use multiple waters and/or Cursna to       |
|     remove it before the person is KOed.                             |
|     - If you are using Trusts, bring out Mihli Aliapoh, Kupipi,      |
|       and/or Apururu (UC) and they'll cast Cursna on the entire      |
|       party.                                                         |
| - After you defeat the Minotaur, there is no cutscene. Just move out |
|   of the area quickly so it doesn't re-aggro you when it spawns      |
|   again.                                                             |
|                                                                      |
| Objective 2                                                          |
|                                                                      |
| - Find the Iron Gate at (G-8) on the second map. You can get there   |
|   from the Minotaur by taking the wooden ladder at (K-5) up and      |
|   dropping at (G-6).                                                 |
|   - Beware of the short one-way drop into the water at (G-8), in the |
|     room with the Iron Gate. If you fall you will need to run around |
|     again.                                                           |
|                                                                      |
| :*A Thief can pick the lock (for example by trading a Skeleton Key   |
| to the gate), or you may defeat Fomors for the Bronze Key to open    |
| the door.                                                            |
|                                                                      |
| - After you pass through the Iron Gate, find the Wooden Ladder at    |
|   (E-8) for a cutscene. Go up the ladder when the cutscene is        |
|   finished.                                                          |
|   - This is more than just the brief cutscene where you see yourself |
|     climbing the ladder. If you didn't get a cutscene with           |
|     Nag'molada, go back and make sure you got credit for killing the |
|     Minotaur.                                                        |
| - Head left through the north door and proceed down the hallway into |
|   the first room you see. Beware, as there are Fomor that link in    |
|   this room and you will likely be attacked immediately if below     |
|   level 70.                                                          |
| - Look for a ??? on a bookshelf in the southwest corner of the room. |
|   This will open a secret one way door on the south side of the room |
|   that you just ran past. Go through the door.                       |
|   - There are two ??? points in this room. The one immediately in    |
|     front of you on the east wall is a trap. It will open a door in  |
|     the eastern wall that will lead to a one-way drop, wasting your  |
|     bronze key.                                                      |
|     - Instead, circle right around the bookshelves to the southwest  |
|       corner of the room for the correct ???, which will open the    |
|       southern wall-door.                                            |
| - In this hallway, there are several torches on the wall. They are   |
|   not obvious to see, so you will probably need to use the tab key   |
|   on your keyboard to target them.                                   |
|   - Do not hit the farthest torch and walk into the room as it is a  |
|     one way door and you will need to run around again.              |
| - Look at which Vana'diel day of the week it is (i.e. Firesday,      |
|   Iceday) and find the oil lamps that correspond to the current day  |
|   and the one that the day is strong against. The chart below        |
|   represents the player facing West towards the false door with the  |
|   lamps on either side.                                              |
|                                                                      |

| - Examine the two corresponding oil lamps within a short period to   |
|   open the door to the west. You can do this solo or have two        |
|   players examine both at the same time.                             |

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to any San d'Orian Conquest Overseer to raise your
Rank bar and unlock this Mission. (1 should be enough)

- Speak to any Gate Guard and accept the Mission from the list.
  - There are two in Southern San d'Oria, Ambrotien at (K-6) and
    Endracion at (F-9). There is also a gate guard in Northern San
    d'Oria, Grilau at (D-8).
  - A Map of La Theine Plateau and Ordelle's Caves can be purchased from
    the Map NPCs in Northern San d'Oria and Southern San d'Oria, but it
    is not required.
- Head to La Theine Plateau and speak to Galaihaurat at (E-6). Please
  note this NPC is at the very top of the cliffs just off the main path
  near a short brick wall.
  - Remember that Map –> Wide Scan is your friend, look for the only
    green dot near the bottom of (E-6).
  - If instead of saying the mission's normal dialogue, \"Are you in the
    rescue drill? Head to the other side of the valley over there. One
    of my compatriots will assist you.\", he (and nearly every other NPC)
    instead says \"The suspect appears to have taken refuge within
    Ordelle's Caves. We will follow our training drills and stick to our
    posts!\", then you have a conflicting quest active, A Timely Visit :
    - If you're in this state, you will have a rather unusual time with
      this quest – all the optional dialogue will prioritize the lines
      from that quest instead of this mission. Only Vicorpasse and
      Laurisse will prioritize dialogue specific to this mission instead
      of the conflicting quest.
    - You might want to finish up that quest by interacting with
      Narvecaint, done both near the beginning and the end of that
      quest, and referring to the guide for that quest to do the rest.
    - However, it's not required to do it first. Necessary interactions
      after talking to Ruillont will work once to allow you to progress
      in the mission where needed, before reverting to dialogue from the
      quest. It's possible to complete the mission in full.
      - As Galaihaurat never provides mission-related dialogue in this
        state and only gives dialogue from the quest, talking to him
        might be entirely Optional in the first place. (This could be
        confirmed on a fresh character by skipping straight to Ruillont
        )
- Descend into the canyon at (F-6), on the east side. Continue south
  into Ordelle's Caves.
  - (Optional): Talk to Galaihaurat, Equesobillot, Deaufrain,
    Vicorpasse, Augevinne, Yaucevouchat, Laurisse, and Narvecaint for
    additional dialogue.
- Follow the left wall and talk to Ruillont (G-3) by the pond.
- Go back to La Theine Plateau. One of three NPCs will give you a Bronze
  Sword: talk to Deaufrain and Equesobillot (F-6) on the ramp, and if
  necessary, Galaihaurat (E-6) by the road.
  - The \"companion\" you have to talk to seems entirely random for each
    player. All other NPCs will continue saying their prior phrases as
    if you hadn't seen Ruillont at all, but these three will respond
    with one of the two phrases:

    

        \"Ruillont's sword? Don't look at me; I've nothing of the sort\"!
        \"Ruillont's sword? Yes, I was keeping it for him during
        training. [...]\"

- Return to Ruillont and trade him the sword.
  - If you have tragically already misplaced the sword and have no way
    to recover it, you'll need to acquire a new Bronze Sword from
    somewhere else.
    - The NPC above who was keeping it will say \"Didn't I give you his
      sword? Just hand it to Ruillont. Don't you lose it!\" and does not
      appear to be able to miraculously give you another one, even if
      you zone after ridding yourself of it.
- Go back to La Theine Plateau. Talk to Vicorpasse (F-6) for Rescue
  training certificate.
- Return to a Gate Guard to complete the Mission.

Walkthrough

If you wish to complete this Mission, trade enough Crystals to a
Conquest Overseer to raise your Rank bar and unlock it.

- Talk to any Gate Guard and accept the Mission.
  - There are two in Southern San d'Oria, Ambrotien at (K-6) and
    Endracion at (F-9). There is also a gate guard in Northern San
    d'Oria, Grilau at (D-8).
  - A map of Davoi can be purchased for 3000 Gil from Elesca at (I-8) of
    North San d'Oria or Violitte at (G-10) of Southern San d'Oria, but
    it is not required.
- Make your way to Davoi. To reach Davoi, zone into Jugner Forest from
  La Theine Plateau at (M-8). Then follow the right wall of Jugner
  Forest to the zone into Davoi at (G-12).
- Talk to the NPC Zantaviat just inside the zone.
- Walk south until you reach a pond at (J-8). On the South bank of the
  pond you will find a ! targetable location. Click on it to receive the
  Lost document.
- Return to Zantaviat to recieve the Temple Knights' Davoi report.
- Return to a Gate Guard.
- Make your way to the Papal Chambers, which is on the top floor of the
  Cathedral in Northern San d'Oria.
- After the cutscene, the Mission will be completed.

    Safehold and then taking the southern exit (H-6) to Misareaux Coast
    will get you there fastest.

|   - The Unity warp for level 122 NM will put you right at the Gate.  |

|   transported to Riverne - Site #A01.                                |
|   - You will need to defeat Firedrakes for 2 Giant Scales.           |
|   - All the wyverns are aggressive to sight as well as the bombs so  |
|     make sure to invis up, using Prisms near the bombs (because they |
|     are aggressive to magic as well.) Hippogryphs are True Sight so  |
|     you will need to avoid them.                                     |
| - Head west to the Spatial Displacement and then northwest to        |
|   another.                                                           |
| - After you have your scales, make you way west to the Unstable      |
|   Displacement at (G-10). When all of your party is close by, trade  |
|   one Giant Scale to the Unstable Displacement. It will allow you to |
|   pass through, but only for a short time. Make sure everyone is     |
|   ready to move when you trade it.                                   |
| - Head west again to the Unstable Displacement at (E-10) and use     |
|   your other Giant Scale in the same manner above.                   |
| - Head straight north and pass through the northeastern displacement |
|   into Monarch Linn.                                                 |
|   - Take care on this island when heading for the spatial            |
|     displacement, because it is filled with Hippogryphs.             |
| - You will now prepare for an instanced fight.                       |
|   - As with the Spire areas of Promyvion, this area is uncapped so   |
|     use the time to prepare for the BC to come.                      |
|   - When you are ready, check the displacement and enter the         |
|     battlefield \"Ancient Vows\". Be sure to buff inside the           |

Windower users with the Enternity or FastCS addons loaded may experience
issues progressing through the final cutscene of this mission.

::*Solutions include unloading the above addons, and typing the command
\"//config FrameRateDivisor 2\" to return your FPS to the default of 30
prior to the start of the cutscene. Hitting Print-Screen to take a
screenshot has also worked. Resizing the window may also unhitch the
cutscene. You may also be required to restart the game without Windower
to progress if these solutions fail to work.

This zone is likely the first time a player will encounter Taurus and
become familiar with Fomor Hate aggro if they accumulate enough.

:*The zone was originally capped at level 50 and required a group. It is
recommended a player be level 60+ if they wish to do it by themselves
fairly easily with Trusts.

:*In addition, you'll want the ability to reapply Sneak on yourself
repeatedly throughout the Mission regardless of your level.

| - The next goal of the mission is to get past the large door with 2      |
|   keyholes at (H-7) on Map 2. There are multiple ways of going about     |
|   this, depending on your circumstances.                                 |

| - You can ask others in-game if they have done the quest A Hard Day's    |
|   Knight to obtain the Temple Knight key.                                |
|   - If you have obtained this key item from the quest then you can open  |
|     the doors for everyone and continue onward.                          |
|                                                                          |
| - To complete the quest and finish this mission on your own, you will    |
|   need to farm the Coral Crest Key ^(/) from Fomors on Map 2 and also    |
|   acquire the Sealion Crest Key ^(/) from the NM Keremet.                |
|   - Instead of trading these to the door with two keyholes, instead      |
|     return to Tavnazian Safehold and trade them to Quelveuiat on the     |
|     middle floor of Tavnazian Safehold, south of Home Point #1 (I-10)    |
|     across the bridge.                                                   |
|     - If you have not started the quest yet then Quelveuiat will ask you |
|       to defeat Splinterspine Grukjuk, which is spawned from the quest   |
|       at the ??? at (H-10) in Lufaise Meadows.                           |
|       - After defeating the NM and speaking to Quelveuiat once more you  |
|         may then trade them the keys to obtain the Temple Knight key.    |
|                                                                          |
| If in a party of multiple characters:                                    |
|                                                                          |
| - You can skip the quest and farm two /Coral Crest Keys from Fomors on   |
|   Map 2 and /Sealion Crest Key from the NM Keremet to do the mission     |
|   without leaving the zone.                                              |
|   - Note that the Coral Crest Key has a rare drop rate, so it maytake a  |
|     number of Fomor.                                                     |
| - See Keremet's page for notes on fighting him if doing this at/near     |
|   level cap.                                                             |
|   - There are two hallways leading to the NM. Each lined with six        |
|     skeletons named Azren Kuba.                                          |
|     - These will all aggro the moment you attack Keremet, but have very  |
|       low HP. You may defeat them before attacking Keremet.              |
|                                                                          |

| After Obtaining the Keys or KI:                                          |
|                                                                          |
| - Proceed to the door at (H-7) map 2.                                    |
|   - If using the keys, have one of your party members with a Coral Crest |
|     Key trade it to the small keyhole and when a click is heard, the     |
|     person with the Sealion Crest Key should trade it to the larger      |
|     keyhole.                                                             |
|   - The Coral Crest Key will break upon use and you have a very small    |
|     amount of time to trade the second key after the first has been      |
|     traded.                                                              |
|     - If you messed up the timing then you will have to farm an extra    |
|       Coral Crest Key.                                                   |
| - After entering, take a right at the fork in the path, proceeding to    |
|   the Wooden Gate at (G-8) for a cutscene.                               |
|                                                                          |
| The Old Professor                                                        |
|                                                                          |
| - Afterwards, double back and exit back into the main hallway the way    |
|   you came, out through the keyhole door at (H-7).                       |
| - Straight across from this door are a small set of stairs leading to a  |
|   door at (H-5). This room is full of Fomors and a ??? at the desk on    |
|   the far side of the room.                                              |
| - Check the ??? in this room to attempt to pop the NM Old Professor      |
|   Mariselle.                                                             |
|   - Only those who are currently on this mission may spawn the           |
|     professor. Other players will get the message there's nothing in the |
|     drawer.                                                              |
|   - If the NM pops, congratulations. Otherwise, go to each of the other  |
|     5 rooms on Sacrarium Map 2 and repeat this process until it pops.    |
|     - All five other rooms have a ??? at the desk but only one of the    |
|       six will pop the NM. So it may take a little running around to     |
|       find the correct one.                                              |
|   - This is where being aware of Fomor Hate reset is useful. Popping the |
|     NM will cause you to lose Sneak and if you happen to have Fomor Hate |
|     and lose Sneak in a room full of Fomors, you're going to get aggro.  |
|     - It may be a good idea to clear the Fomor from the room prior to    |
|       attempting to pop the NM so you can face it and the adds alone.    |
| - After you pop Old Professor Mariselle, it will spawn 2 ghosts named    |
|   Mariselle's Pupil. They are weak so you shouldn't worry about them.    |
|   - Mariselle will periodically warp around the room so keep an eye on   |
|     it.                                                                  |
| - After it is defeated, everyone on the missions needs to check the ???  |
|   to receive the Reliquiarium key.                                       |
|                                                                          |
| Wrapping Up                                                              |
|                                                                          |
| - Head back to the large door with the 2 keyholes at (H-7).              |
|   - The Temple Knight key will let you slide right through if you're     |
|     using that method.                                                   |
|   - Parties of multiple people will now have to use that second Coral    |
|     Crest Key and Sealion Crest Key to repeat the process from earlier.  |
|   - It is also possible to leave one person behind the locked door, and  |
|     reopen it using the switch.                                          |
| - Once past the doors, return to the same Wooden Gate again for a        |
|   cutscene to end the mission.                                           |

| - Travel to (H-11) on Purgonorgo Isle in Bibiki Bay and speak with the ??? Warmachine for a cutscene  |
|   - You can reach Purgonorgo Isle by taking the Manaclipper in Bibiki Bay (H-7).                      |
|     - You can use Unity Warp (Level 119) to bring you close to the Manaclipper dock.                  |
|     - Speak with Fheli Lapatzuo on the dock to make sure you're going to the right island and ensure  |
|       that you have tickets from Tswe Panipahr nearby.                                                |
|   - Alternatively, you can clear the first 4 Voidwatch NMs on the Tavnazian path to gain a direct     |
|     warp to the island, without having to have been there before. (recommended as you will be coming  |
|     back later)                                                                                       |

| While in Newton Movalpolos, farm the Gold Key after you finish the BCNM, exiting to Newton            |
| Movalpolos. This will save you some time later.                                                       |

|   - The Gusgen Mines Survival Guide will bring you very close to the Oldton entrance.                 |
| - The next step is the BC at Mine Shaft #2716 and there are several options to get to the BC          |
|   entrance. Any of the following options work (pick up the home point if you do not already have it): |
|   - 1) (Fastest) Take the Newton Movalpolos Home Point #1 (Places you right outside the Mine Shaft    |
|     #2716).                                                                                           |
|   - 2) (Fast) Trade a Snow Lily to Tarnotik at (K-10) in Oldton Movalpolos and he will warp you       |
|     there.                                                                                            |
|     - The Lily can be purchased from the Auction House ([] ➞ Materials ➞ Alchemy) or dropped from     |
|       Uleguerand Tiger in Uleguerand Range.                                                           |
|     - If you chose this option, make sure to get x2 Lilies, as you'll have to come back one more      |
|       time. Alternatively, make sure you collect the Home Point and you can warp back without the     |
|       second lily.                                                                                    |
|   - 3) Gamble with Twinkbrix at (E-13) in Oldton Movalpolos by trading him Gil (1~10,000) until you   |
|     win the Shaft 2716 operating lever, then pay him 2000 more Gil to warp you there.                 |
|     - On Lightsday, trading Twinkbrix a will make him use not-, giving you the best odds as if you    |
|       had traded 10,000, and also changes his dialogue.                                               |
|   - 4) The old fashioned (long) way of walking through Newton Movalpolos and operating the furnace    |
|     hatches.                                                                                          |
|     - This requires at least 3 people.                                                                |
|     - (Alternative walk) You only need 1 Firesand if someone can tractor you up the east ledge in     |
|       Oldton Movalpolos at (K-10), the person raising runs from the hp in Newton Movalpolos to exit   |
|       3.                                                                                              |
|     - You can get the Proto-Waypoint this way too if you started the quest Researchers from the West. |
|       Tractor up the south ledge, it is used in multiple The Voracious Resurgence Missions.           |
|       - The Proto-Waypoint into Newton Movalpolos is also fastest way to get to the mobs that drop    |
|         Gold Key.                                                                                     |
| - Before the battle is commenced, make sure to zone out into Newton Movalpolos and attune to the Home |
|   Point just outside after being teleported to Mine Shaft #2716 (you will need this later on, several |
|   times).                                                                                             |

| - After you have made your way to Mine Shaft #2716 rest up and go over strategies. When you are       |
|   ready, click on the Shaft Entrance and enter the battlefield \"A Century of Hardship\".               |
|   - Note: Take caution not to enter an ENM instead of the Mission battlefield A Century of Hardship.  |
|     You will need to return here again for this Mission and you must wait 5 days before obtaining     |
|     another Shaft 2716 operating lever.                                                               |
|   - Buffs will wear when you enter so make sure to buff while inside the battlefield.                 |
|                                                                                                       |

| - Head to Mine Shaft #2716 (see above for methods of getting there) and trade the Gold Key to the     |
|   shaft entrance to get a cutscene.                                                                   |

- If you have completed the other 2 paths (Tenzen's Path, Ulmia's Path),
  Cid will give an additonal cutscene and you can move on to the next
  Chapter: For Whom the Verse is Sung.

Optional (Windurst)

- One Good Deed? is available from Chipmy-Popmy (C-8) in Port Windurst.
  - One Good Deed? and The Search for Goldmane can be progressed in
    tandem with Partners Without Fame.

Walkthrough

- If you did not already do so, speak with Cid (in Bastok - Metalworks -
  Home Point #1) to begin this Mission.

- Head to Southern San d'Oria (A-6) (Home Point #4) and speak with
  Hinaree on the second floor of the manor for a short cutscene.

Entanglement

- Zone into Port San d'Oria for a cutscene. Using the Home Point works.
- Speak with Chasalvige (L-6) in the Cathedral's Manuscript Room in
  Northern San d'Oria, left of the entrance.

Head Wind

- Travel to Windurst Waters (J-8) (Home Point #3) and speak with
  Kerutoto in the North wing of the Rhinostery. You may need speak with
  her more than once, as she offers other quests.

:*The correct cutscene for this Mission is about you \"standing there
like a muddled mandragora\" and of a girl with \"crikey-spiky hair\".

- Go to Windurst Walls (E-5) (Home Point #1) and speak with Yoran-Oran.
- Head to Attohwa Chasm (H-6), enter Boneyard Gully, and prepare for a
  boss fight.
  - Home Point #1 in Attohwa Chasm or the Unity Warp (Level 125) will
    get you close to the entrance.

With the lifting of the level cap on this battlefield, this battle is
now relatively trivial in difficulty. The walkthrough below was written
for a level cap of 50.

| - Head to (G-6) in La Theine Plateau and click on the ??? there.     |
|   - There are several other quests that begin at this ??? so you may |
|     need to watch several cutscenes to make sure you got the right   |
|     one.                                                             |
|   - The Unity Warp (Level 99) will bring you close.                  |
|                                                                      |
| Check the ??? where you talk to Carbuncle in La Theine Plateau for a |
| cutscene with Carbuncle and Tenzen.                                  |
|                                                                      |

| - Head to the Tower at (J-8) in Beaucedine Glacier and enter         |
|   Pso'Xja.                                                           |
|   - The Unity Warp (Level 125) will bring you close.                 |
| - This Tower is not a maze. There are a total of 16 Stone Doors that |
|   you must pass through normally, but each one of them has a high    |
|   chance to spawn a Gargoyle when you check it.                      |
|   - Defeat the Gargoyle and move through the Door quickly as it      |
|     won't stay open for very long.                                   |
|   - Some things to remember:                                         |
|     - The Doors cannot be opened from the other side (i.e. one-way). |
|       If you're in a party and someone doesn't make it through the   |
|       Door in time, they will be stuck.                              |
|     - There are various other mobs in some of these rooms that are   |
|       aggressive. Cryptonberries aggro to Sight, Magic Millstones    |
|       aggro Magic.                                                   |
|     - These monsters WILL aggro you through the Doors so take        |
|       caution fighting close to the next Door.                       |
|     - It is possible for a Thief to pick the trap and open the Door  |
|       without spawning a Gargoyle, although it rarely works.         |
|     - Some Doors may not spawn anything and simply open.             |
| - After you have made your way past all 16 Doors, sneak up and head  |
|   down the elevator.                                                 |
| - Check the Avatar Gate at the bottom for a cutscene.                |
|                                                                      |

| - Head to (G-10) in Upper Jeuno - Home Point #3 and speak with       |
|   Monberaux for a cutscene to obtain a Envelope from Monberaux.      |
| - Speak with Pherimociel at (G-6) - Home Point #1 - in Ru'Lude       |
|   Gardens for a cutscene.                                            |
| - Return to Monberaux in Upper Jeuno for some dialogue.              |
|                                                                      |

| - Enter Batallia Downs from Upper Jeuno. Next to the other side of   |
|   the wall near the entrance to town, at (K-8/9), there is a ???.    |
|   Check it for a cutscene.                                           |
| - Check the ??? again to obtain a Delkfutt recognition device.       |
| - Head to the entrance of Lower Delkfutt's Tower.                    |
|   - The fastest way if you have at least White stratum abyssite III  |
|     from Voidwatch is the Atmacite Refiner you're already standing   |
|     next to:                                                         |

|   - The Survival Guide just inside the tower is fastest otherwise    |
| - Go to (H-5) on the first floor of Lower Delkfutt's Tower and check |
|   the Cermet Door to spawn a Disaster Idol.                          |
|   - This mob uses normal Doll moves, as well as casting Tier 3-ga    |
|     spells and Tier 4 single target spells based on the current      |
|     Vana'diel day.                                                   |
|   - If in a party, the Disaster Idol only needs to be killed once    |
| - After you defeat the Disaster Idol, check the Cermet Door once     |
|   again for a cutscene.                                              |
|                                                                      |

| - Head to the tower at (H-10) in Beaucedine Glacier and enter        |
|   Pso'Xja for a cutscene.                                            |
|   - Make sure you have some Silent Oils and Prism Powders,           |
|     regardless of level. Unless you're high enough and want to fight |
|     your way through.                                                |
|   - The Unity Warp (Level 125) will bring you close.                 |
| - There are a few one way walls in here that can be confusing. Walk  |
|   around the outer perimeter of the map until you are almost back    |
|   where you started (I-8).                                           |
| - Head west through the wall and drop through a hole in the floor.   |
| - Exit the room to the south, follow the hallway, and enter the room |
|   to the north at the end of the hallway.                            |
| - Take the elevator down to the Avatar Gate for a cutscene.          |
| - Return to Cid once again to finish this path.                      |

|   - (Optional): Speak to Parelbriaux by the Walnut Door at (K-7),    |
|     Prishe's room, on the top floor of Tavnazian Safehold for a      |

|   - (Optional): Speak to Odeya at (J-10) near a water pump on the    |
|     top floor of Tavnazian Safehold for a cutscene. This is down the |
|     ramp from Despachiaire's Room.                                   |
|   - The two optional steps above provide some context for this       |
|     mission, but they are ultimately lead ins for the X Marks the    |
|     Spot quest, and are not necessary to move 5-1 forward.           |

| - Speak with Cid in the Metalworks for a cutscene.                   |
| - Travel to the Nue Tower at (F-7) in Beaucedine Glacier, and enter  |
|   the uncapped area of Pso'Xja for a small cutscene. (Home Point     |
|   will not work.)                                                    |

|   door will spawn a Golem named Nunyunuwi.                           |

|   no Diremites at the bottom of this elevator ride).                 |

Walkthrough

- After the scene in Lufaise Meadows and receiving your Ducal Guard's
  Ring, head toward Tavnazian Safehold and zone in for a cutscene.
  - Any homepoint in Tavnazia will work. You do not need to run through
    Lufaise Meadows.
- The following cutscenes can be done in any order:
  - Zone into Sealion's Den for another cutscene.
  - Exit Sealion's Den, run straight ahead to the entrance to Phomiuna
    Aqueducts on the bottom floor and click it for cutscene with
    Louverance.
  - Check the Walnut Door at (K-7) on the top floor of Tavnazian
    Safehold (Home Point #3) for a cutscene with Ulmia that completes
    the mission.

Walkthrough

- Make your way toward the north Dilapidated Gate in Misareaux Coast
  (F-7) and check it for a cutscene.
  - The Level 122 Unity Warp to Misareaux Coast will put you just south
    of the the gate.
  - Otherwise warp to Tavnazian Safehold (Home Point #1), exit to the
    Misareaux, and proceed to (F-7).
- Return to Sealion's Den and speak with Sueleen
- Travel to Ru'Lude Gardens and head toward the Palace for a cutscene.
  - The Ducal Guard's Ring you obtained previously can warp you right in
    front of the Palace.
- Travel to Upper Jeuno and check the door of the Marble Bridge Tavern
  for a final cutscene.
  - Optional:' Talk to Mojuro-Nojuro out front before and after
    interacting with Marble Bridge. He'll jest about a hypothetical 33rd
    Marble Bridge day when talking to him afterwards: Next thing you
    know, they'll be having \"Goblin's Day.\"
  - If you are on RoV missions, you might need to click the door twice
    for this cutscene to trigger after the RoV cutscene

Path |Title=None |Reward=None |Image= }}
Note: If you have not finished Rhapsodies of Vana'diel and plan to very
soon, you might consider finishing that before continuing.
Once you start The Warrior's Path, your last chance to progress in
Rhapsodies will be during A Fate Decided, after which you'll be unable
to progress until the final cutscene of Dawn, which includes a Japanese
Midnight wait.

Walkthrough

- After your conversation with Cid, you will be off to fight 3 monsters
  all across the globe. They can be defeated in any order.

Boggelmann

- Travel to (E-7) in Misareaux Coast and check the Storage Compartment
  there to spawn a Bugard named Boggelmann.
  - Unity Warp 122 will take you near it.
  - It has high defense and uses Blood Weapon.
- Check the Storage Compartment again after it is defeated for a
  cutscene and obtain the Vessel of light.

Cryptonberry Executor

- Head to Carpenters' Landing from the east entrance in Jugner Forest
  (J-8).
  - Survival Guide to Carpenters' Landing is fastest.
  - Alternatively the Unity Warp (Level 119) will bring you close.
  - The Abyssea - Vunkerl maw is also nearby.
- Travel to (I-9) in Carpenters' Landing and look for a ??? near the
  water. Clicking this ??? spawns a Cryptonberry Executor (NIN).
  - Shortly after he pops, 3 Cryptonberry Assassins (THF, SMN, BLM) will
    appear.
  - They can all use their respective job's 2 hour ability. Avoid Mijin
    Gakure by killing the Executor first, and very quickly.
  - Astral Flow is the next concern, but it is still significantly
    weaker then the Executor's Mijin Gakure.
  - Make sure your party's HP remains high until the NIN and SMN are
    defeated.
- Check the ??? again once the Tonberries are dead to receive a
  cutscene.

Dalham

- Travel to (F-6) in Bibiki Bay and look for a ??? inside a cave.
  Clicking this spawns a Kraken-type mob named Dalham.
  - Both the Survival Guide and Unity Warp 119 are similarly close.
  - It doesn't use any 2 hour ability although it may appear that it has
    been using Hundred Fists by the time the fight is over.
  - The familiar \"Dust Cloud\" 2 hour animation can be seen at several
    points during the fight, however, they only indicate that Dalham is
    increasing its attack speed, not using a 2 hour.
- Check the ??? after defeating Dalham for a cutscene.

Finishing Up

- After all of the monsters have been defeated, return to Cid to obtain
  Letters from Ulmia and Prishe.
- Talk to Sueleen in the Sealion's Den (H-6) (near Tavnazian Safehold
  Home Point #2) for a cutscene.

- Travel to Sealion's Den and click the Iron Gate for a cutscene.
- When your party is ready, click the Iron Gate and enter the
  battlefield \"The Warrior's Path\".
  - Although this mission is uncapped, your buffs will still wear off
    when entering so make sure to buff inside.
  - It should also be noted that once you enter this battle, you cannot
    leave until you either win or lose.

Boss Fight (Spoiler Free!)

To see the opponent's identity, click on the first \"???\" link.

- If ??? happens to connect all weapon skills during Meikyo Shisui, it
  will create a level 4 skillchain called Cosmic Elucidation dealing
  massive damage and ejecting you from the battle.
- After you beat ???, you will receive a cutscene and appear in
  Al'Taieu.

Walkthrough

- Speak to any Bastokan Gate Guard to accept the Mission.
- You will have to obtain 4 Fetich pieces ( , , and .)
  - The Fetich pieces are not Exclusive, and can be traded or purchased
    from Bazaars or the Auction House. ([] ➞ Others ➞ Beast-made)
  - Alternatively, you can kill Quadavs (Amber Quadav, Greater Quadav,
    Onyx Quadav, Veteran Quadav) in Palborough Mines which drop the 4
    Fetich pieces.
- If you elect to get these items yourself and not purchase them, travel
  to (K-3) in North Gustaberg to enter Palborough Mines.
  - You can reach North Gustaberg from Port Bastok (L-7) or South
    Gustaberg by zoning at (H-5).
  - To get to the higher level Quadav, travel north until you hit the
    big room at (G-7). Make your way over to (H-7) and head south,
    turning right at the split, followed by a left. This will put you on
    a straight path down to (H-9) where you'll follow the bend into a
    circular room, followed by another bend twisting north and finally
    end up at the elevator in the center.
  - Take the elevator up to the second floor by pulling the lever to
    make it go up and down.
  - This entire floor is filled with Onyx Quadav, Greater Quadav, and
    Veteran Quadav about Lv.13 (Be careful of Zi'Ghi Boneeater, a
    Lvl.15-16 NM).
  - ⚠ Note: Using the boat at (H-8) on the second floor will transport
    you to Zeruhn Mines and will place you on the other side of a
    guarded gate. You won't be able to pass this gate to get back, so be
    careful.
- Once you obtained your 4 Fetich pieces, trade them simultaneously to
  one of the Bastok Gate Guards to complete the Mission.

This Mission is essentially identical for all 3 Nations. While each
Nations requires you to travel to the other two, they all follow the
same path.

:*San d'Orians and Windurstians who choose Bastok first will do the same
things. Therefore, it IS possible to group people together from
different Nations to ultimately end up on the same BCNM fight.

:*A Windurstian may choose to do the Bastok portion first, and San
d'Orian portion second, while a Bastokan can do the Windurstian portion
first, and the San d'Orian portion second. In this scenario,
Windurstians and Bastokans can enter the same BCNM for the San d'Orian
portion.

:*Players who have already completed this Mission (for any Nation) may
enter any of the BC, except for the one associated with their Nation.

::*E.g. A Windurstian who has completed 2-3 is unable to enter the
Giddeus BCNM to help others, unless they have completed this battle
through another Nation's 2-3 Mission.

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals (3+) to a Conquest Overseer if you wish to skip
Mission 2-2 and immediately unlock this one, then accept it from the
Gate Guard.

- You will be instructed to speak with Halver. He is located at (I-9)
  just inside the door of Chateau d'Oraguille, entered from Northern San
  d'Oria.
- Halver will instruct you to visit two other Nations: Bastok and
  Windurst.
  - After reaching Rhapsodies of Vanadiel Mission 1-7 you will be given
    a Cipher: Halver if you do not already possess this Trust.
- The next leg of this Mission can be done in two different ways:
  - Go to Bastok first and then to Windurst.
  - Go to Windurst first and then Bastok.
- If you have never visited Bastok or Windurst, you can \"Unity warp\" to
  either South Gustaberg or East Sarutabaruta, then make the rest of the
  trek on foot. Speak to Urbiolaine in Southern San d'Oria (G-10) and
  choose \"Bring me to a Wanted encounter area\", then \"Content level 99
  and below.\"
- The Bastok Path may be quicker due to the ease of obtaining the item
  involved.
  - Bastok will require obtaining a Mine Gravel, which can be bought off
    the Auction House.
  - Windurst will require obtaining two Parana Shields, but these are
    100% drops and can be obtained in 5 minutes apart.
- The Windurst Path final BCNM may be a bit easier as the Petrify AoE
  will not be used.

category:Missions

Option 1: Bastok Path

San d'Oria to Bastok

- Once you get to Bastok head to the Metalworks and speak with Savae E
  Paleade at the San d'Orian Consulate located on the top floor at
  (I-9).
- Next speak with Pius inside the Dept. of Industry located on the same
  floor of the Metalworks at (J-8).
- You will be asked to speak to Grohm. He is inside the Craftsmen's
  Eatery at (G-9) of the top floor.
  - In the unlikely event that you already have a Mythril Sand sitting
    around, you can now use it right away by trading it to Savae E
    Paleade and be able to skip to the last step in this section.
    - Since the item has the 'Alt' (CanSendPOL) tag, an extra from
      another character within the same PlayOnline account can transfer
      them to other characters. However, since it's it can't be traded
      between characters otherwise.
    - You also might have one from Windurst Mission 2-3 or by simply
      already exploring the mines. /itemsearch \"Mythril Sand\" can help
      you find any onzes you might already have.
- Your main task now is to acquire one Mythril Sand:
  - At this point you should head to the Auction House and buy one Mine
    Gravel (Others ➞ Misc. 1) to save a lot of time and walking. If you
    do not want to do this and want to do the work yourself, use the 3
    Pickaxes you are given during the cutscene (you are not guaranteed
    to mine the gravel with only 3 axes used).
  - You can also buy Pickaxes from Boytz at (H-7) of Bastok Mines or
    Numa at (E-7) of Port Bastok if you feel the need to mine it
    yourself, or if the AH does not have sufficient supply.
  - A map of Palborough Mines can be purchased for 600 Gil from Karine
    at (H-9) of Bastok Markets or Rex at (J-7) of Port Bastok.
- Head to Palborough Mines, enter at (K-3) of North Gustaberg.
  - The fastest way here initially (for character who has reached level
    99), is to use Domenic to warp to Waughroon Shrine, then exit to the
    Palborough Mines Home Point. If the player uses /BLM, they can
    Escape to the entrance proper.
    - If you already have Mine Gravel, you can go directly from the Home
      Point to the Refiner Lid.
  - If you did not purchase the Mine Gravel at the Auction House follow
    the left wall until you get to (F-7). Look for a Mythril Seam. Trade
    your Pickaxe to the seam until you get a Mine Gravel.
    - There are also two Mythril Seams on the west bank (in the
      northwest corner) of the room at I-8 on the way to the elevator.
- Once you have a Mine Gravel make your way to the elevator at (I-8) on
  the east bank and ride it up to the 3rd floor. The route there goes
  through the southern loop at (H-9).
  - Make your way to Map 3's (I-6) where you will find a Refiner Lid.
    Trade our gravel to the Refiner Lid and then pull the Refiner Lever.
  - Walk off the ledge or follow the path to the floor below and the
    bottom of the machine. Pull the Refiner Lever here and you will
    receive an Onz of Mythril Sand.
    - If you're doing the Mythril Marathon RoE, you can trade in two
      batches and get all 10 at once at the bottom.
    - If you forgot to pull the lever at the top after trading, fear
      not: just run around the short loop to the southwest and the
      tunnel will ramp back up to the top.
- Return to the Consulate and trade the sand to Savae E Paleade. You can
  now head to Windurst.

  - It is MUCH easier to buy one from the Auction House. Crystal Bass
    cap at 35 for fishing, so plan accordingly.
  - See below for fishing tips.

  - Repeating this Missions is similar to Mission 1-2. You do not need
    to zone between repeating, you also do not have to repeat the steps
    in Chateau d'Oraguille.

Fishing for Crystal Bass

- Obtain Level 20 or higher.
  - Characters less than 14 days old and below level 20 will experience
    Fishing Fatigue: after catching 10 fish in a day, you can not catch
    any more until the next day (midnight Japanese time). Otherwise your
    daily fishing limit is 200 fish.
  - Goblin Bounty Hunters patrol shorelines for low level players. Level
    30s should be able to ignore them.
  - Outside of cities, you can fish up monsters. There's a different
    message if there's a monster on your line. (More about fishing
    messages below)
- Fishing skill optional.
  - Any fish involved in Missions (such as this one) or Quests can be
    caught with 0 skill unless otherwise specified like Inside the
    Belly.
  - Fishing skill determines how many gold arrows appears in the
    mini-game, which wear out the fish's faster.
- Obtain a fishing rod and tackle:
  - Carbon Fishing Rod or Halcyon Rod (craft with Alchemy or buy on AH)
    are synthetic rods good for catching small fish.

    - These rods are some of the most durable non-legendary fishing rods
      and the line rarely breaks for any kind of small fish and items
      like Rusty Leggings.

  - Alternatively, Bamboo Fishing Rod can be purchased in Southern San
    d'Oria from Lusiane (F-8) if San d'Oria is first place in conquest.
    - It is a less durable rod, so it won't be as successful for reeling
      in items or certain fish (see specific fish pages for notes).

  - (Optional) Obtain 1 Minnow (NPC buyable). It is a lure, does not
    stack.

  - Obtain some Insect Balls, they stack to 99. As much as you're
    comfortable with. These are good for early skill up and can catch
    Crystal Bass (while avoiding Crayfish and Red Terrapins). Use as a
    backup in case something takes your lure.
- (Optional) The mission requires 1 Crystal Bass. However, there is
  another RoE objective for catching 10 Crystal Bass. Vana'versary ->
  15th Vana'versary III -> All That Glitters... (W)
- Go to Jugner Forest and find the Crystalwater Spring (J-9).
- Equip your fishing rod in the ranged slot. Bait goes in the ammo slot.
- Target yourself and use the Fishing action next to the water.
- Wait for the right fishing message.
  - \"Something caught the hook!\" <- One exclamation point. It is a small
    fish. Reel it in.
  - \"Something caught the hook!!!\" <- Three exclamation points. It is a
    \"large fish\". The music may change. There are no large fish in the
    crystal spring... that is a tree ( Arrowwood Log). It will break
    your rod. Press Esc to let it go.
  - \"You feel something pulling at your line.\" <- Some rusty items. It's
    junk and you won't skill up either.
    - \"You have a bad/terrible feeling about this one.\" <- This appears
      at the end of a message, hinting how likely something is hooked
      that will break your rod based on your fishing skill and rod's
      strength. It's probably trees. Press Esc to let it go.
  - \"Something clamps onto your line ferociously!\" <- Monster. They
    don't drop crystal bass.

Missions 3-3 to 5-2 can be done with any Nation, as they are all
ultimately the same. (They will require cutscenes in their own cities,
but the bulk of the work is identical for each.)

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- Speak to Halver in Chateau d'Oraguille at (I-9).
- Click the Door: Great Hall behind Halver for a cutscene. You will
  obtain Letter to the ambassador.
- Head to the San d'Orian Embassy in Ru'Lude Gardens (H-9) and speak
  with Nelcabrit.
  - If you already possess the (trade it to the door) or the Delkfutt
    key (no trading needed) then you may skip this climb:
    - Head to Lower Delkfutt's Tower (E-8) Map 1 and enter the Basement
      by clicking the Cermet Door. Once you go through the door, proceed
      to (L-8) and click the Cermet Door for a cutscene. (Note: Another
      player using a key does not work.)
    - Return to the San d'Orian Embassy in Ru'Lude Gardens and click the
      Door: San d'Orian Emb. for a cutscene to complete the Mission.
  - If you do not possess the Key, start the climb process detailed
    below:
    - You may be Tractored through this Basement door without the Key.
      If you decide to go this route, proceed to the \"Obtaining Delkfutt
      Key Short Way\" section.
    - Otherwise, read the \"Obtaining Delkfutt Key\" section.
- Head to Lower Delkfutt's Tower using the Survival Guide teleportation,
  Outpost warp, or Home Point warp.
- You will now likely need to climb to the 10th floor of Delkfutt's
  Tower in order to gain a in order to access the Basement of the Tower:

Obtaining Delkfutt Key Short Way

This is the shortest route. You may be Tractored through the door to the
Basement at Lower Delkfutt's Tower (E-8) Map 1 without the Key if a
party member already has it.

- Next, you can open the door at (J-8).
- Click it to travel to Upper Delkfutt's Tower. Walk forward then click
  the ??? at the bottom of the stairs to be teleported directly to:
- Porphyrion, kill this NM then trade the it drops to the Elevator
  directly beside it.
- After using the elevator, proceed down the spiral stair case for two
  zones, through the Cermet Door in Map 5 at (I-9) Upper Delkfutt's
  Tower.
- Skip to the \"Finishing the Mission\" section below.

Obtaining Delkfutt Key

This process involves a multi-zone, ten-floor run up the entire tower.
Expect the climb up alone to take roughly 15 minutes. If you are below
level 50, consider bringing the following:
*Sneak/Invisible (Status) or / .
*Some form of Reraise and Warp is also helpful.
Set your Home Point in Jeuno if you plan on warping out after the
Mission.

- A map of Qufim Island and a Map of Delkfutt's Tower may be purchased
  from Promurouve at (H-7) in Lower Jeuno (inside the building) or
  Rusese at (H-6) in Upper Jeuno for 3,000 Gil each.
- Make your way to Port Jeuno and zone into Qufim Island.
- Enter Lower Delkfutt's Tower at (F-6).
- Once inside prepare for a long walk. Bats and Dancing Weapons will
  aggro to Sound and Goblins and Giants will aggro to Sight. Pots and
  Dolls are Aggressive to Magic.

Navigation

- Floor 1: (Lower Delkfutt's Tower)
  - Enter and follow the right wall until you reach the stairs at
    (E/F-6).
- Floor 2:
  - Follow the left wall until you reach the stairs at (I-9).
- Floor 3:
  - Follow the right wall until you reach the Teleporter at (G-6).
- Floor 4: (Middle Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)
  - Follow the right wall past 2 Teleporters and go up the stairs at
    (J-6).
- Floor 5: (half way there)
  - Enter the door into a hallway on your right at (I-7) then follow the
    left wall until you see a stairway leading north at (H-10).
- Floor 6:
  - At the top of the stairs follow the right wall to a Teleporter at
    (J-10).
- Floor 7:
  - In this big room head north-west to a stairway at (G-7).
- Floor 8:
  - Follow the left wall to another stairway at (J-7).
- Floor 9:
  - Head south to a stairway that leads back down at (J-10).
- Floor 8: (again)
  - Head west to a stairway leading back up at (G-10). Do not fall down
    the hole in the floor!
- Floor 9: (again)
  - Follow the left wall until you reach a Teleporter at (F-6).
- Floor 10: (Upper Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)
  - When you zone in head through the door to the south-east and down a
    hallway. You will find a door on your right at (H-7). This door is
    guarded by Mimas, a Gigas NM that uses Hundred Fists.
  - After killing Mimas and clearing the hallway enter the door at (H-7)
    into a large room. This room will be filled with Gigas and a NM
    named Porphyrion.
    - Try to pull Porphyrion out into the hallway without linking any of
      the other Gigas. Summoner or a high level helper is useful for
      this.
- Kill Porphyrion and any aggro you may have. Porphyrion will drop 6  s.
  If you need more then 6 you will have to wait 10 minutes for him to
  re-pop.
  - After defeating Porphyrion, you may choose to head up two more
    floors to reach the Home Point on the twelfth floor. This will save
    you from having to ever do this climb again. Be advised that higher
    floors will contain enemies that are level 65+ and will aggro.
- Once you have your Key, trade it to the elevator on the floor at (H-8)
  inside Porphyrion's room.
- Walk down the LONG staircase after using the elevator to get to the
  Basement.

Finishing the Mission

- Once you reach the Basement head east into a large room and trade your
  (or interact if you have the Delkfutt key) on the door at (L-8) for a
  cutscene.
  - If you do not get the cutscene you are probably at the wrong door.
- Return to the San d'Orian Embassy in Ru'Lude Gardens and click the
  Door: San d'Orian Emb. for a cutscene to complete the Mission. You may
  now safely drop your Delkfutt Key.
  - If you don't have Warp: head through the doorway at (J-9), continue
    down the path, and open the door at the end. You'll be at Lower
    Delkfutt's Tower (E-8). Follow the right wall until you return to
    Qufim Island.

- Rusese — Upper Jeuno (H-6)

Beadeaux (Prerequisite)

Note: This prerequisite can be done either before or after the Davoi and
Castle Oztroja sections of this mission. It's up to you whether you want
to get the requisite Key Items now, or in concert with the Beadeaux
section.

- Mages will need Echo Drops for this area.
  - Beadeaux has a gimmick whereby you must inflict Silence upon
    yourself when passing through certain sections to stop yourself
    being Cursed, Curse will decrease your HP/MP and cause you to walk
    slower.
- Everything in this area aggros sound, therefore only Sneak is
  necessary.
- Set your Home Point in Jeuno and bring some form of Warp. (You may
  purchase Scroll of Instant Warp from the Conquest NPC under Common
  all-rank items for 10 points.)
- You will have to kill two level 40-45 NM in this zone. Having trusts
  summoned before applying Sneak and heading out is recommended.
- Enter Beadeaux from Pashhow Marshlands (L-11).
  - If you have a high level helper it is easier at this point to send
    them ahead to kill the NM's and then just lot the drops. If this is
    the case you can head back to Jeuno as soon as you have both items.
  - You may also consider leveling to 60 (which is most likely your
    current cap).
- Follow the left wall to a tunnel at (H-7).
- Inside follow the right wall until you get to a Mute device inside a
  circular room. The Mute has an effervescent glow and appears like a
  huge mushroom. Click this device and it will silence you. This will
  allow you to pass the up coming Afflictor without being Cursed.
- Head south after you have been silenced and then follow the tunnel
  west until you reach the exit at (F-8).
- Outside reapply silence at the Mute in front of you (There is another
  Afflictor in this area) and then head southwest to a ramp at (E-10).
- Once you are on the upper area turn right and go across the bridge.
  Follow this path across a second and a third bridge then remove your
  silence. Follow the right wall here until you reach (H-9/10).
- Here you will find De'Vyu Headhunter. He is a Warrior NM. He will drop
  the Quadav Charm.
- Now turn around and head northeast back toward where you came from.
- Follow the right wall now until you reach (F-6).
- Here you will find Go'Bhu Gascon, another Warrior NM. He will drop the
  other required item, Quadav Augury Shell.
- Head back to Jeuno.
- Trade both items to Sattal-Mansal.
  - These must be traded separately through the use of two trades.
  - If you trade him both items at once you will not get both of the KIs
    you need to open the door in the Qulun Dome. The second item will
    still be in your inventory.

Magicites

Davoi Magicite

This part of the mission can be soloed but a group or high level help
will make death less likely.
You will need to reach the Monastic Cavern in Davoi. Davoi is located in
Jugner Forest (G-12).

- Make your way to Davoi.
- Once you've entered, head to (G-7).
  - There will be two Orcs here - either kill them or sneak past them.
- Drop invisible and click on the Wall of Dark Arts, you'll be able to
  enter the Monastic Cavern.
  - If you aggro the Orcs you can quickly run through the Wall to the
    zone a few feet ahead.
- Inside there will not be any enemies. Walk down the path into a large
  room and inspect the Magicite to obtain the Magicite: Optistone.

Maps

File:Davoi-map.jpg | Davoi Map File:Monastic Cavern.jpg | Monastic
Cavern Map

Castle Oztroja Magicite

This part of the Mission can be soloed but a group or high level help is
highly recommended.

- You will need both s and s.
- There are areas of this zone where anyone under Level 60 will still
  receive aggro.

You will need to reach the Altar Room in Castle Oztroja. The Castle is
located in Meriphataud Mountains (L-8).

- Enter the Castle and head to the Brass Door at (I-8). You will see a
  lever at either side of the door. One lever will open the door and the
  other will open a trap in the floor and cause you to fall into a pit.
  There is a very easy way to open this door:
  - Stand between the two levers in front of the door, click one of the
    levers and immediately run back.
  - If it is the trapped lever there is some lag between when the lever
    is clicked and when the trap door opens. If the door opens run
    through, if the trap opens wait for it to close and then use the
    other lever.
  - The game is very picky about where you stand to hit the lever. You
    may have to move around a bit until you don't see the \"Target is out
    of Range\" message.

This Mission is essentially identical for all 3 Nations. While each
Nations requires you to travel to the other two, they all follow the
same path.

things. Therefore, it IS possible to group people together from
different Nations to ultimately end up on the same BCNM fight.

:*A Windurstian may choose to do the Bastok portion first, and San
d'Orian portion second, while a Bastokan can do the Windurstian portion
first, and the San d'Orian portion second. In this scenario,
Windurstians and Bastokans can enter the same BCNM for the San d'Orian
portion.

  for a cutscene with Zeid. You will have to reach the Qu'Bia Arena and
  clear the BCNM \"The Rank 5 Mission\".

      the zone to Qu'Bia Arena.
    - Unity Warp (Level 128) will place you at the entrance of Fei'Yin.
    - Unity Warp (Level 125) will place you in the central area of
      Beaucedine Glacier.

    Freeze, he may also use Manafont.

    for managing the many extra mobs. A Monk using Hundred Fists also
    shines in this fight, due to the skeleton blunt penalty.

Navigation

[]

Castle Zvahl Baileys

- Head for Xarcabard. Castle Zvahl is on the far west of the area at
  (D-7/8).
- Enter Castle Zvahl Baileys, follow the one-way path until you come to
  the first intersection. Turn right, head north then west and down a
  small flight of stairs.
- Turn left and follow the right wall until you reach the next map.
- On the next map, turn right and head all the way to the top right
  corner of the map.
- Head up the stairs and you will be on the second \"level\".
- Next, get to the top left part of the map and walk back down the set
  of stairs and you'll be back on the first \"level\".
- Work your way into the center of the map from here and you will be in
  an outdoor courtyard. Go back up to the second \"level\" then through
  the gate on the right and you'll be in a long hall with a large flight
  of stairs.

Castle Zvahl Keep

- At this point you can use the Shadow Lord Shirt, if you have it.
  - This will skip this whole navigation section, by teleporting you
    directly in front of the door (next to the Homepoint).
- Inside, walk out of the hallway and turn right. Ahead, you will have
  to go through a few gates, there are a lot of mobs in the area which
  detect sight, however your party should have no problems disposing of
  them.
- Once on the second level, you will be overlooking a room below. Follow
  the narrow path to more stairs and another hallway. You'll eventually
  reach an area with teleporters. These teleporters take awhile to
  activate, so just stand on the center and be patient. Using them will
  cause your Invisible (Status) to drop.
- Follow the teleporters four times until you reach a new map. Run to
  the west/middle of this area and you'll see a door. Passing through
  this door will result in a zone to the Throne Room.

BCNM Fight

You will now have some time to prepare for the fight, run to the other
side of the Throne Room and gather up. When ready, check the door and
enter the BCNM.

- The Shadow Lord has 2 forms. In the first form, he can switch between
  physical or magical immunity. Take time during magic immunity to rest
  MP, and hold off on melee attacks while in physical.
- While immune to magic, he will use Dark Nova (AOE Darkness damage) and
  can cast Black Magic. Dark Nova tends to indicate that he will switch
  to physical immunity.
- During physical immunity, he can use a variety of TP attacks,
  including Giga Slash, Kick Back and Umbra Smash.
- Defeating the first form will get you a cutscene. You will immediately
  be returned to the fight. Rest quickly and get ready for the second
  form.
- The second form will only use AoE attacks, but has less HP
  (approximately 4,000 HP). At this point, use your 2hrs and take him
  down as fast as possible. Curaga should be used liberally here to help
  counter the AoE damage. He will not rotate immunities like the first
  form.

first, then RNG. If you have problems landing sleep on the PLD, he can
be killed next; if there are few issues, keep him alive for Aspir and
target the DRG. Ignore the wyvern, you will still exit the BC with a win
once all Orcs are dead if the wyvern is still alive: Instead, keep him
slept and use for Aspir. Use Gravity and Bind (though do not waste the
MP for these on the RNG, obviously, as he still attacks from a
distance). Try to silence the PLD to prevent him from curing himself.

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- Go to Chateau d'Oraguille, where you'll receive a cutscene upon
  entering.
- Speak to Halver for instructions.
  - (Optional): Interact with the two doors to the Princes' quarters for
    short cutscenes.
- Travel to the Quicksand Caves Map 2.
  - The cave entrance at Eastern Altepa Desert (H-10) will place you on
    Map 2.
    - Located just east of the Survival Guide warp to Eastern Altepa
      Desert.
    - Alternatively, using the Unity Warp (Level 125) for Quicksand
      Caves will place you at (J-6) on Map 1. You will need to walk
      south and then west to (F-10) to reach Map 2.
- You will need to drop down a hole at (E-11) to reach an isolated
  portion of the map.
- Once you drop down, travel to the Fountain of Kings at (G-14).
- Clear the area and check Fountain of Kings. This will spawn 2 Kraken
  NMs: Honor and Valor:
  - You can pull them one at a time, they will not link, but will aggro
    to sound.
  - Valor uses Hundred Fists.
  - Honor casts Paralyga and Silencega.
  - It is possible to land Blind and Gravity on either, but both resist
    Sleep.
  - Letting one depop and then defeating the other makes this a lot
    easier to deal with.
- Check the Fountain of Kings again, after the bodies disappear, for
  some Drops of Amnio.
- Return to Halver.
- Wait 1 Earth minute, then exit the Chateau (into Northern San d'Oria)
  for another cutscene.

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- Head to Chateau d'Oraguille and check the Great Hall door for a
  cutscene.
- Speak with Rahal (H-9, western door directly across from the entry
  way) to receive the Crystal dowser and further instructions.
- Head to the Temple of Uggalepih and farm a Prelate Key from the
  Tonberry Stabbers on Map 3/4.
  - See the note below before farming the key. Alternatively you may
    farm Tonberry Choppers in the Yhoator Jungle or Tonberry Slashers in
    the Den of Rancor.
  - Several Tonberry Slashers spawn in the large room near the Den of
    Rancor Unity Warp (Level 128).
- Make your way through the Temple until you reach the door at (I-10) on
  Map 2, that can only be opened by killing the Temple Guardian.
  - The Temple of Uggalepih Geomagnetic Fount is closest.
  - The Guardian will not be there and the door will be open if someone
    has defeated it in the last 15 minutes.
- Pass into the big room, and head upstairs and through the door at
  (J-10) which requires the Prelate Key.
  - Note: The door on top of the east set of stairs can be bypassed
    without a Prelate Key. One way of doing this is summoning a Trust
    that moves away from you, such as Yoran-Oran, engaging an enemy in
    front of the door, and hoping that the Trust runs through the door.
    This is a much faster method than dealing with the low drop rate of
    the key.
- From west to east, go through the first, third, and fourth doors in
  the hall, checking the ??? in each.
  - Each ??? will provide a Piece of a broken key.
  - Each player in the party must obtain the 3 Piece of a broken key in
    order to complete the final cutscene.
- After you have all 3 keys, select the second door to spawn 2 Doll NMs:
  Nio-Hum and Nio-A.
  - Both have around 6500 HP, do regular Doll attacks, and cannot be
    slept.
  - You may pull one at a time if Sneak is activated before spawning.
  - The Dolls are aggressive to magic so you may not pull with magic.
- After the Dolls have been defeated, check the door again for a
  cutscene.
- Return to Chateau d'Oraguille and check the Great Hall door for a
  cutscene.
- You will be awarded Rank 9 and 80,000 Gil.

  Sorrows. This is the same entrance used for Adamantoise/Aspidochelone.
- Sneak and Invisible across to (I-8) and check the ??? to receive the
  Figure of Titan.

    be used.

Xarcabard

- Head for Xarcabard and go to (H-7) upper level.
  - The Survival Guide for Xarcabard brings you to (H-9), almost due
    south of the ramp you need to ascend.

  west of the ramp (still in H-7).
- Select the ??? to obtain the Figure of Garuda.

Batallia Downs

(F-8) to open the doors in the Eldieme Necropolis by yourself.

- Head for the southern Eldieme Necropolis entrance at (I-10) in
  Batallia Downs.
  - The Survival Guide to Eldieme Necropolis is located just inside this
    entrance.
- Make your way to the southern room, and then to the center hole at
  (G-9). You will likely need Sneak in the basement, do so before
  dropping down.
- With Map: When you drop down your in-game map will change floors.
  Follow the immediate path heading East. A very short distance later
  this path will change your in-game map again. Head to the exit at
  (J-9) into Batallia Downs.
  - Without Map: After dropping down, go east and then south, and take a
    right at the intersection, and start heading up a hill. You will
    eventually zone back out to Batallia Downs.
  - Optional: If Ahtu is up, kill it first, it should not pose a problem
    to anyone in the party.
- Check the ??? near the cliff to spawn two Greater Bird NMs: Suparna
  (WAR) and Suparna Fledgling (WHM).
  - Note: There are multiple ??? on this island. Check the one near the
    Stone Monument at the rear of this island.
  - They can both use Horde Lullaby and Massacre Elegy as well as their
    own respective abilities, such as Mighty Strikes and Benediction,
    and typical Greater Bird TP attacks.
  - You can pull just one, but it is difficult. Recommended that you
    kite one NM and kill the other, then finish the kited one off.
- Defeat both NMs and check the ??? again to receive a cutscene and the
  Figure of Leviathan.
- Head back to the Chateau and check the Great Hall door for a final
  cutscene, completing the Mission.

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- Zone into Northern San d'Oria for a lengthy cutscene.
  - If you accepted the Mission from the Northern San d'Oria gate guard,
    you can talk to Arnau to see they are still preparing the Rites.
  - You will be prohibited from zoning into Chateau d'Oraguille due to
    increased security until you've triggered the cutscene in Northern
    San d'Oria.
- Zone into Chateau d'Oraguille for a cutscene.
- Head to Fei'Yin for a cutscene.
- Make your way to Qu'Bia Arena for a two-part BCNM fight, \"The Heir to
  the Light\".
  - Use Fei'Yin Home Point #1 or Domenic to teleport right outside the
    arena, then walk a short distance to zone into the small room with
    the Burning Circle.
- Part One will have Death Clan Destroyer (WHM Warmachine), Yukvok of
  Clan Death (Unsleepable Orc RNG), 3 Worgbut of Clan Death, 3 Rallbrog
  of Clan Death, and 3 Vangknok of Clan Death (Orcs, Sleepable).
  - Open with Elemental Seal+Sleepga II or Horde Lullaby, and start
    attacking the Ranger mob first. Make sure you silence the
    Warmachine, as it is a WHM who can Curaga and wake everything up.
    Defeat the Ranger, followed by the Warmachine, and then take our the
    rest.
  - Sleep the last mob before killing it, and give yourself a rest.
    There will be no time after the first part of the fight to rest.
- Part Two will include Prince Trion fighting by your side, against 3
  Orc NMs, Warlord Rojgnoj (PLD unsleepable), Rojgnoj's Left Hand (BLM),
  and Rojgnoj's Right Hand (DRK).
  - Trion will randomly attack a mob, and should be helped. Preferably,
    the order to kill the NMs is BLM > PLD > DRK. Trion can be cured and
    can die in the BC. Should he die, you will be ejected from the BC.
    Despite being a Paladin, he isn't great at keeping himself alive.
  - Keep the other mobs silenced, a Paladin with Invincible is useful
    here for keeping attention.
- Upon clearing the battlefield, zone into Northern San d'Oria for a
  cutscene.
- Head to the Chateau and check the Great Hall door for another
  cutscene.
- Make your way to (H-8) in King Ranperre's Tomb and check the Heavy

If you have sufficient time, you may consider pairing this Mission with
your level 60 Limit Break Whence Blows the Wind, as you have to visit
the same three zones. However, Whence Blows the Wind objectives take
significantly more time to complete than the objectives of this Mission.
If you examine the Survival Guides in the area, you can easily come back
to the zones later.
*This Mission is identical for all three Nations. If you have completed
this mission in another nation, you will not have to complete the
prerequisite quests again, as the Key Items are saved, you will only
need to re-obtain the Magicites.

Maps

Before you head out, if you haven't already bought your maps, now is the
time to do it. They can be purchased for 3,000 Gil from the following
NPCs:

- Elesca — Northern San d'Oria (I-8)
- Violitte — Southern San d'Oria (G-10)
- Karine — Bastok Markets (H-9)
- Rex — Port Bastok (J-7)
- Mhoji Roccoruh — Port Windurst (G-9)
- Pehki Machumaht — Windurst Woods (H-11)
- Promurouve — Lower Jeuno (H-7)
- Rusese — Upper Jeuno (H-6)

Beadeaux (Prerequisite)

Note: This prerequisite can be done either before or after the Davoi and
Castle Oztroja sections of this mission. It's up to you whether you want
to get the requisite Key Items now, or in concert with the Beadeaux
section.

- Mages will need Echo Drops for this area.
  - Beadeaux has a gimmick whereby you must inflict Silence upon
    yourself when passing through certain sections to stop yourself
    being Cursed, Curse will decrease your HP/MP and cause you to walk
    slower.
- Everything in this area aggros sound, therefore only Sneak is
  necessary.
- Set your Home Point in Jeuno and bring some form of Warp. (You may
  purchase Scroll of Instant Warp from the Conquest NPC under Common
  all-rank items for 10 points.)
- You will have to kill two level 40-45 NM in this zone. Having trusts
  summoned before applying Sneak and heading out is recommended.
- Enter Beadeaux from Pashhow Marshlands at (L-11).
  - If you have a high level helper it is easier at this point to send
    them ahead to kill the NM's and then just lot the drops. If this is
    the case you can head back to Jeuno as soon as you have both items.
  - You may also consider leveling to 60 (which is most likely your
    current cap).
- Follow the left wall to a tunnel at (H-7).
- Inside follow the right wall until you get to a Mute device inside a
  circular room. The Mute has an effervescent glow and appears like a
  huge mushroom. Click this device and it will silence you. This will
  allow you to pass the up coming Afflictor without being Cursed.
- Head south after you have been silenced and then follow the tunnel
  west until you reach the exit at (F-8).
- Outside reapply silence at the Mute in front of you (There is another
  Afflictor in this area) and then head southwest to a ramp at (E-10).
- Once you are on the upper area turn right and go across the bridge.
  Follow this path across a second and a third bridge then remove your
  silence. Follow the right wall here until you reach (H-9/10).
- Here you will find De'Vyu Headhunter. He is a Warrior NM. He will drop
  the Quadav Charm.
- Now turn around and head northeast back toward where you came from.
- Follow the right wall now until you reach (F-6).
- Here you will find Go'Bhu Gascon, another Warrior NM. He will drop the
  other required item, Quadav Augury Shell.
- Head back to Jeuno.
- Trade both items to Sattal-Mansal.
  - These must be traded separately through the use of two trades.
  - If you trade him both items at once you will not get both of the KIs
    you need to open the door in the Qulun Dome. The second item will
    still be in your inventory.

Magicites

Davoi Magicite

This part of the mission can be soloed but a group or high level help
will make death less likely.
You will need to reach the Monastic Cavern in Davoi. Davoi is located in
Jugner Forest (G-12).

- Make your way to Davoi.
  - Survival Guide and proto-waypoint warp are about the same.
- Once you're in Davoi, go to (G-7).
  - There will be two Orcs here - either kill them or sneak past them.
- Drop invisible and click on the Wall of Dark Arts, you'll be able to
  enter the Monastic Cavern.
  - If you aggro the Orcs you can quickly run through the Wall to the
    zone a few feet ahead.
- Inside there will not be any enemies. Walk down the path into a large
  room and inspect the Magicite to obtain the Magicite: Optistone.

Maps

Castle Oztroja Magicite

Note: Recommended to do before starting:

- Go back to Upper Jeuno, trigger the cutscene with Paya-Sabya, go to
  Lower Jeuno, and trigger the cutscene with Muckvix to receive Yagudo
  torch.
- Go back to Altar Room for an initial cutscene with Fickie, and then a
  subsequent cutscene when touching the magicite.
- Seems that the Yagudo torch portion is required, even if someone else
  can get you through.

This part of the Mission can be soloed but a group or high level help is
highly recommended.

- You will need both s and s.
- There are areas of this zone where anyone under Level 60 will still
  receive aggro.

You will need to reach the Altar Room in Castle Oztroja. The Castle is
located in Meriphataud Mountains (L-8).

- Enter the Castle and head to the Brass Door at (I-8). You will see a
  lever at either side of the door. One lever will open the door and the
  other will open a trap in the floor and cause you to fall into a pit.
  There is a very easy way to open this door:
  - Stand between the two levers in front of the door, click one of the
    levers and immediately run back.
  - If it is the trapped lever there is some lag between when the lever
    is clicked and when the trap door opens. If the door opens run
    through, if the trap opens wait for it to close and then use the
    other lever.
  - The game is very picky about where you stand to hit the lever. You
    may have to move around a bit until you don't see the \"Target is out
    of Range\" message.
- Proceed upstairs, you'll be on Map 2. Head to (G-7) where you will
  exit into a courtyard in Map 6.
- On this map, head north (without falling off) to a hallway entrance at
  (I-7) which will lead you to Map 7.
- Here follow the right wall until you reach a door at (H-9).
  - The mobs in this area are much higher level then the ones previously
    encountered.
- At the door, light the Torch and you will be taken through.
- Head south and take a right to another Brass Door. Click on the door
  to open it.
  - The zone is just beyond this door so run like hell if you have
    aggro.
- Inside you will be in the Altar Room, an area with no mobs. Click on
  the Magicite to receive the Magicite: Orastone.
- If the cutscene did not trigger, and you received a message that the
  \"magicite glows ominously,\" then try the recommendation listed above
  to get the Yagudo torch.

Beadeaux Magicite

You will need to reach the Qulun Dome in Beadeaux. Beadeaux is located
in Pashhow Marshlands (L-11).

- Everything in this area aggros sound, therefore only Sneak is
  necessary.
- From the entrance of Beadeaux, hug the left wall until you reach a
  tunnel entrance at (H-7).
- Make your way down the tunnel and once you reach the intersection, go
  left. You'll zone into Qulun Dome.
  - The Beadeaux proto-waypoint warp puts you next to the Qulun Dome
    entrance you need.
- There are no monsters in here. Investigate the Door to open it. Inside
  you'll the find the Magicite, click it to obtain the Magicite:
  Aurastone.

This Mission is the same for every other Nation.

- Players who are on the same Mission (5-1 or higher) with the New
  Fei'Yin seal, or have completed it for their current Nation, will be
  able to join you.

Walkthrough

[Fei'Yin Map|thumb]

- Speak to a Gate Guard. You'll be directed to the President's Office.
- Speak to Naji for a cutscene, and to receive the New Fei'Yin seal.
  - If you are low level, you might want to use Trusts or form a party
    of lvl 50+ players.
- Go to Fei'Yin (located in the northeast corner of Beaucedine Glacier)
  for a cutscene with Zeid. You will have to reach the Qu'Bia Arena and
  clear the BCNM \"The Rank 5 Mission\".
  - The majority of enemies in Fei'Yin detect by sound, however there
    are several that detect spellcasting.
  - Quick Travel options:
    - Home Point #1 to Fei'Yin is the fastest way, it puts you right at
      the zone to Qu'Bia Arena.
    - Unity Warp (Level 128) will place you at the entrance of Fei'Yin.
    - Unity Warp (Level 125) will place you in the central area of
      Beaucedine Glacier.
  - From the entrance of Fei'Yin go east to (K-8). There are 2 Dolls in
    front of a door named Cermet Portal, open it and you'll be able to
    enter Qu'Bia Arena.
- Head to Qu'Bia Arena at (K-8) map 1 and prepare for a BC, all buffs
  will wear upon entering. Plan accordingly and click the Burning Circle
  when ready.
  - You only need to kill the Archlich to win.
  - You will be facing Archlich Taber'quoan. The Archlich will spawn
    with 2 Ancient Sorcerers. Ancient Warriors will also spawn in the
    hallway and run to help of the Archlich during the fight.
  - The Archlich is a BLM, and will cast spells like Sleepga II and
    Freeze, he may also use Manafont.
  - The lesser skeletons have very little HP and can be easily taken out
    by an AoE spell.
  - Focus attacks on the Archlich, a Paladin with Invincible is useful
    for managing the many extra mobs. A Monk using Hundred Fists also
    shines in this fight, due to the skeleton blunt penalty.
  - When you win, you'll be given another cutscene and receive Burnt
    seal.
- Return to Naji to complete the Mission.

Notes

- Zoning to Metalworks directly after finishing the last Mission, will
  cause the Metalworks music to be replaced with \"Despair (Memoro de la

Navigation

[]

Castle Zvahl Baileys

- Head for Xarcabard. Castle Zvahl is on the far west of the area at
  (D-7/8).
- Enter Castle Zvahl Baileys, follow the one-way path until you come to
  the first intersection. Turn right, head north then west and down a
  small flight of stairs.
- Turn left and follow the right wall until you reach the next map.
- On the next map, turn right and head all the way to the top right
  corner of the map.
- Head up the stairs and you will be on the second \"level\".
- Next, get to the top left part of the map and walk back down the set
  of stairs and you'll be back on the first \"level\".
- Work your way into the center of the map from here and you will be in
  an outdoor courtyard. Go back up to the second \"level\" then through
  the gate on the right and you'll be in a long hall with a large flight
  of stairs.

Castle Zvahl Keep

- Inside, walk out of the hallway and turn right. Ahead, you will have
  to go through a few gates, there are a lot of mobs in the area which
  detect sight, however your party should have no problems disposing of
  them.
- Once on the second level, you will be overlooking a room below. Follow
  the narrow path to more stairs and another hallway. You'll eventually
  reach an area with teleporters. These teleporters take awhile to
  activate, so just stand on the center and be patient. Using them will
  cause your Invisible (Status) to drop.
- Follow the teleporters four times until you reach a new map. Run to
  the west/middle of this area and you'll see a door. Passing through
  this door will result in a zone to the Throne Room.

BCNM Fight

You will now have some time to prepare for the fight, run to the other
side of the Throne Room and gather up. When ready, check the door and
enter the BCNM.

- The Shadow Lord has 2 forms. In the first form, he can switch between
  physical or magical immunity. Take time during magic immunity to rest
  MP, and hold off on melee attacks while in physical.
- While immune to magic, he will use Dark Nova (AOE Darkness damage) and
  can cast Black Magic. Dark Nova tends to indicate that he will switch
  to physical immunity.
- During physical immunity, he can use a variety of TP attacks,
  including Giga Slash, Kick Back and Umbra Smash.
- Defeating the first form will get you a cutscene. You will immediately
  be returned to the fight. Rest quickly and get ready for the second
  form.
- The second form will only use AoE attacks, but has less HP
  (approximately 4,000 HP). At this point, use your 2hrs and take him
  down as fast as possible. Curaga should be used liberally here to help
  counter the AoE damage. He will not rotate immunities like the first
  form.

    (E/F-6).
- Floor 2:
  - Follow the left wall until you reach the stairs at (I-9).
- Floor 3:
  - Follow the right wall until you reach the Teleporter at (G-6).
- Floor 4: (Middle Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)
  - Follow the right wall past 2 Teleporters and go up the stairs at
    (J-6).
- Floor 5: (half way there)
  - Enter the door into a hallway on your right at (I-7) then follow the
    left wall until you see a stairway leading north at (H-10).
- Floor 6:
  - At the top of the stairs follow the right wall to a Teleporter at
    (J-10).
- Floor 7:
  - In this big room head nort-hwest to a stairway at (G-7).
- Floor 8:
  - Follow the left wall to another stairway at (J-7).
- Floor 9:
  - Head south to a stairway that leads back down at (J-10).
- Floor 8: (again)
  - Head west to a stairway leading back up at (G-10). Do not fall down
    the hole in the floor!
- Floor 9: (again)
  - Follow the left wall until you reach a Teleporter at (F-6).
- Floor 10: (Upper Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)

    guarded by Mimas, a Gigas NM that uses Hundred Fists.
  - After killing Mimas and clearing the hallway enter the door at (H-7)
    into a large room. This room will be filled with Gigas and a NM
    named Porphyrion.
    - Try to pull Porphyrion out into the hallway without linking any of
      the other Gigas. Summoner or a high level helper is useful for
      this.
- Kill Porphyrion and any aggro you may have. Porphyrion will drop 6  s.
  If you need more then 6 you will have to wait 10 minutes for him to
  re-pop.
  - After defeating Porphyrion, you may choose to head up two more
    floors to reach the Home Point on the twelfth floor. This will save
    you from having to ever do this climb again. Be advised that higher
    floors will contain enemies that are level 65+ and will aggro.
- Once you have your Key, trade it to the elevator on the floor at (H-8)
  inside Porphyrion's room.
- Walk down the LONG staircase after using the elevator to get to the
  Basement.

  (or interact if you have the Delkfutt key) to the Bastok door listed
  below for a cutscene.
  - Windurst's Door is at (L-7)/(M-7).
  - San d' Oria's Door is at (L-8)/(M-8).
  - Bastok's Door is at (K-9)/(L-9).
  - If you do not get the cutscene you are probably at the wrong door.
- Return to the Bastokan Embassy in Ru'Lude Gardens and click the Door:
  Bastokan Emb. for a cutscene to complete the Mission. You may now
  safely toss your Delkfutt Key
  - This is the 3rd door inside the embassy building. There are multiple
    doors with the same name.

- Speak to Iron Eater inside the President's Office in Metalworks Home
  Point #1 at (J-8) for a cutscene.
- You'll be instructed to go to Beadeaux. Gather up a party or go solo
  if you are high lvl.
  - You can teleport with the Unity Warp Lvl.122 to Pashhow Marshlands,
    or Survival Guide if you have it. The Survival Guide inside Beadeaux
    is much closer.
- Zone in to Beadeaux for a cutscene. You will then need to kill 20
  Copper Quadavs. If you are with a party, all kills count towards the
  total, so you can split up to speed the process up.
  - There are 7 Copper Quadavs in the entry area, before the tunnel, and
    3 in the tunnel at the first afflictor.
    - Using all 10 spawns makes this Mission doable in less than 8
      minutes.
  - The game will track how many you've killed, and you don't need to
    kill them all at once.
  - Be careful if you use Valaineral as your Trust, his Uriel Blade
    skill will AoE and most likely kill multiple Quadavs, the additional
    kills will not count.
- Upon killing 20 Copper Quadavs, zone out to Pashhow Marshlands for
  another cutscene. This ends the Mission.
  - Make sure you get the cutscene with Ayame.
  - If you do not get your 20 Copper Quadav kills, you will receive a
    different cutscene.
  - If you use Escape, you will not receive the cutscene.

    map, just south of the pond.
  - Alternatively, there is a Survival Guide to Map 1.
  - Everything in the area will aggro. If in a party, you could have
    other players wait at (H-7), as it is safe there from aggro.
- Checking the ??? will spawn Gigaplasm, a slime NM.
  - Trivial at 99 with Trusts.
  - You can Sneak pull, sleep the NM and run back to camp. The NM will
    eventually make its way to you.
  - Slime NMs have high melee resistance. Casters will be very
    important, and sleeping the mobs will be imperative.
  - You will start against one Gigaplasm, defeating it will cause it to
    divide in 2 Macroplasms. Each of those will divide into 2
    Microplasms, and those will divide into 2 Nanoplasms. Try to keep as
    many mobs asleep as you can. Commence by killing one line of
    Macroplasms (defeat one, defeat its Microplasms, and then its
    Nanoplasms), and then the second. Sleep repeatedly. The HP of the
    mobs gets progressively lower, to the point where a decently
    equipped BLM should be able to one-shot a Nanoplasm with a single
    Thunder III. The key to this fight is keeping everything asleep.
  - Avoid giving the mobs too much TP, as they can use the typical nasty
    slime TP attacks, like Fluid Spread.
- Defeat all of them and Sneak everyone to the ???. Check it to receive
  the Miraclesalt.
- Return to Rabao and speak to Dancing Wolf for a cutscene.
- Head back to Alois to finish the Mission.

Notes

- Although this Mission may prove difficult for some, it can be easily
  completed by two RDM/BLM, who gravity the Gigaplasm, drag it back up
  to the first map, and take it to the zone line. Proceed to nuke and
  sleep at a distance. If you are standing far enough away, you will not
  have aggro on the plasm divisions.
- One possible strategy from here is to have one player sleep one of the
  divisions, while the other casts gravity and zones the second split,
  causing it to deaggro and eventually depop. If done properly and
  repeated each time the plasm splits, this mission becomes drastically
  easier. You will still receive credit for completing the mission so
  long as one Nanoplasm is defeated.

Notes

- Although the first phase of this fight is very easy, the second phase
  requires more preparation. If trying to low-man this BC, it is
  advisable to kill Zeid's summons, as they can deal a substantial
  amount of damage if allowed to skillchain.
- Was able to win with level 75 DRK/NIN, WHM/BLM, and BRD/WHM (2 boxed),
  with the DRK using Dread Spikes in phase two and saving his tp to one
  shot one of the two initial summons.
- Valaineral got killed on the 3rd or 4th step of the skillchain when
  ignoring the summons on a 78 WAR/SAM
- You can still rush down Zeid after this, but if you are attempting
  this at more of an era level, then you may have more success swapping
  to the two summons and back onto Zeid in his 2nd form.

This Mission is not required and is completely skippable. It is
recommended to only subject yourself to it if you are a completionist or
masochist.

Walkthrough

- Accept the mission from the Gate Guard.
  - (Optional): As usual, you can speak to the gate guards for
    additional dialogue.

  final game hour of the time limit. Speaking to him any sooner won't
  trigger the completion cutscene and speaking to him later will fail

This Mission is essentially identical for all 3 Nations. While each
Nations requires you to travel to the other two, they all follow the
same path.

:*San d'Orians and Windurstians who choose Bastok first will do the same
things. Therefore, it IS possible to group people together from
different Nations to ultimately end up on the same BCNM fight.

:*A Windurstian may choose to do the Bastok portion first, and San
d'Orian portion second, while a Bastokan can do the Windurstian portion
first, and the San d'Orian portion second. In this scenario,
Windurstians and Bastokans can enter the same BCNM for the San d'Orian
portion.

:*Players who have already completed this Mission (for any Nation) may
enter any of the BC, except for the one associated with their Nation (A
Windurstian who has completed 2-3 is unable to enter the Giddeus BCNM to
help others, unless they have completed this battle through another
Nation's 2-3 Mission).

Walkthrough

Trade three Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- This Mission can be long if you do not have Home Points, and is broken
  down in to two legs. Whichever Nation you choose first determines how
  the next plays out. The Bastok path progression is typically easier
  and faster.
- Speak with Kupipi in Heavens Tower. She is inside the Clerical
  Chamber. She will give you a Letter to the consuls.
  - You may receive Cipher: Semih if you don't already have it and are
    participating in Trust.

Option 1: Bastok Path

Windurst to Bastok

- Speak to Patt-Pott in Bastok Metalworks HP#1. He is inside the
  Windurstian Consulate top floor (I-7).
- Speak to Pius in the President's Office Department of Industry (J-8).
- Speak to Grohm at (H-9) in the Craftsmen's Eatery. He will give you 3
  Pickaxes. Consider buying more, as they can break. Although 3 should
  be sufficient, you are not guaranteed to get the gravel before all
  your pick axes break.
- Make your way to Palborough Mines in North Gustaberg, at the very
  north of the zone. You will need to mine Mine Gravel from the Mythril
  Seams located throughout the zone. There is one on the first floor at
  (I-8), and one on the top floor at (I-9). Trade the Pickaxe to the
  Seam until you receive some Mine Gravel.
  - You CAN purchase Mine Gravel from the Auction House. ([] ➞ Others ➞
    Misc. 1)
- Once you receive the Mine Gravel, head to the second floor, and make
  your way to (I-7). Trade the gravel to the refiner and then pull the
  lever. Drop off the ledge to the level below and pull another lever.
  You will receive Mythril Sand.
- Trade the Mythril Sand to Patt-Pott. Talk to him once more. This is
  the end of the Bastok leg.

Bastok to San d'Oria

- Speak to Kasaroro in the Windurstian Consulate in Northern San d'Oria
  (H-9).
- Speak to Halver in Chateau d'Oraguille.

    MUST be able to accept the Trust Cipher (not already have one in
    your inventory) when speaking to him in order to be able to enter
    the battlefield at Horlais Peak.
- Go to Horlais Peak and clear the BCNM \"The Rank 2 Final Mission\".
  - If you are low level consider forming a party (and/or use Trusts) of
    level 25 or higher, but make sure everyone has gear for a level 25
    fight. A BLM or RDM is ideal for this fight, as you'll want sleep.
  - To get to Horlais Peak use the Homepoint to Yughott Grotto or make
    your way to Ghelsba Outpost from West Ronfaure, it is in the
    northwestern corner. Inside, follow the left wall until you zone in
    to Yughott Grotto. Follow it all the way to the end, around (K-5).
    You should exit to Fort Ghelsba.
  - Outside, head straight and stick to the left wall. You should start
    going up hill. Follow it around. At the top, there will be a large
    hut to your right. Enter it and go to the back, there is a hidden
    entrance here. It returns to Yughott Grotto#4. Head for (J-6) to
    enter Horlais Peak.
  - Prepare and enter. Buffs will wear on zone, so buff up inside. Make
    your way to the top to face off against two NMs, an Ahriman called
    Seeker and a Dragon called Dread Dragon.
  - Sleep the Dragon and then defeat the Seeker, who is weak. Attack the
    dragon and take it down. This fight is really easy with a full
    party.
  - If you are low level it can easily be defeated with a MNK/WAR and
    WHM/BLM. Can be soloed by some jobs with a lot of meds, and duoed by
    almost any melee job with a WHM healer.
- Return to Kasaroro at Northern San d'Oria after clearing the BCNM.
- Return to Kupipi Heavens Tower to complete the Mission.

Option 2: San d'Oria Path

Windurst to San d'Oria

- Make your way to San d'Oria and visit the Windurstian Consulate in
  Northern San d'Oria.
- Speak to Heruze-Moruze and then Kasaroro, both at (H-9).
- Head over to Chateau d'Oraguille and speak to Halver. He will send you
  to Ghelsba Outpost.
  - Ghelsba Outpost is located to the far northwestern corner of West
    Ronfaure.
- Inside, head for (H-7) and look for the NM Warchief Vatgit and defeat
  him (its only purpose is for this Mission, and is usually up and
  wandering around. If not, wait a short time, it doesn't take long).
  - The Survival Guide to Fort Ghelsba will bring you close to the NM.
    Just zone back out to Ghelsba and across the bridge.
- Speak to Kasaroro again. You are now finished with the San d'Oria half
  of this Mission.

San d'Oria to Bastok

- Make your way to Bastok. Enter the Metalworks from Bastok Markets.
  Make your way to the top and speak with Patt-Pott inside the
  Windurstian Consulate, around (I-7).
- Speak to Pius in the President's Office. He will send you to the
  Craftsmen's Eatery to speak to Grohm.
  - If you're low level, form a party (and/or use Trusts) of level 25 or
    higher, but make sure everyone has gear for a level 25 fight. A BLM
    or RDM is ideal for this fight, as you'll want sleep.
- Make your way to Palborough Mines, in the very far north of North
  Gustaberg.
- Inside, make your way to (I-8) and head upstairs. Here, make your way
  to (H-10) and zone in to Waughroon Shrine.
- Prepare and enter. Buffs will wear on zone, so buff up inside. Make
  your way to the top to face off against two NMs, an Ahriman called
  Seeker and a Dragon called Dark Dragon.
  - Sleep the Dragon and then defeat the Seeker, who is weak. Attack the
    dragon and take it down. This fight is really easy with a full
    party.
  - It can easily be defeated with a MNK/WAR and WHM/BLM. Can be soloed
    by some jobs with a lot of meds, and duoed by almost any melee job
    with a WHM healer.
- Once cleared, return to Patt-Pott in Metalworks.
- Your journey is almost complete, head back to Heavens Tower in
  Windurst Walls and speak to Kupipi to complete the Mission and receive
  your rewards.

    main floor.
- Speak to Hakkuru-Rinkuru at the Orastery in Port Windurst (E-7) for
  hints on Ajido-Marujido's whereabouts.
  - Home Point #1 is closest to Hakkuru-Rinkuru.
- Go to Castle Oztroja and fall down the trap door ((I-8) first Map) for
  a cutscene.
  - Enter and go to (I-8). There will be two switches (not torches) and
    a fairly obvious floor panel. One switch will open the door, one
    will open the floor. Stand in between the two switches and check
    one. If it opens the door, check the other. They randomly switch, so
    it will never be the same, day by day.
  - The person doing the Mission must be the one to pull the lever.
    Multiple people doing this mission will need to stand back until the
    trap door closes then individually pull the lever.
  - In the same room you drop into there is a Blank Target, which is for
    the Onion Rings quest. You can collect Old ring without having the
    Quest flagged.

  - See the Three Mage Gate page for details on your options.
  - Quick Travel options, if previously unlocked:'''
    - Survival Guide for Toraimarai Canal, then zone at (F-5).
    - There is a Home Point as well, but it is further. If you have the
      Home Point then you very likely already have the Survival Guide.
- Pass the Three Mage Gate and continue on to the small room at (G-7).
- Check the Gate of Light for a cutscene.
- Return to Heavens Tower and speak to Zubaba to finish the mission.

Zubaba does not give you the Portal charm. To obtain it, finish the
mission and trade a Rolanberry to Kupipi.

Repeating or Skipping the Mission

This Mission will work differently if: you have skipped this Mission and
obtained a higher Home Nation Rank after completing The Final Seal, or
are simply repeating it.

- Accept the mission and speak to Zubaba. She will ask for you to bring
  her 3 Rusty Daggers. These can be purchased on the Auction House (but
  may be rare), or obtained from the Wendigos past the Three Mage Gate
  (the same skeletons that drop test answers).
- Trade Zubaba the daggers to complete the mission. Obtaining the Portal
  charm is done the same way as completing the mission regularly.

Missions 3-3 to 5-2 can be done with any Nation, as they are all
ultimately the same. (They will require cutscenes in their own cities,
but the bulk of the work is identical for each.)

Walkthrough

Trade enough Crystals to the Conquest NPC to raise your Rank bar and
unlock the Mission, then accept it from the Gate Guard.

- Check the Vestal Chamber door at the top of Heavens Tower for a
  cutscene with the Star Sibyl. You will receive Letter to the

  (I-9) for a cutscene.
  - If you already possess the (trade it to the door) or the Delkfutt
    key (no trading needed) then you may skip this climb:
    - Head to Lower Delkfutt's Tower (E-8) Map 1 and enter the Basement
      by clicking the Cermet Door. Once you go through the door, proceed
      to (L-7) and click the Cermet Door for a cutscene. (Note: Another
      player using a key does not work.)

  - If you do not possess the Key, start the climb process detailed
    below:
    - You may be Tractored through this Basement door without the Key.
      If you decide to go this route, proceed to the \"Obtaining Delkfutt
      Key Short Way\" section.
    - Otherwise, read the \"Obtaining Delkfutt Key Long Way\" section.
- Head to Lower Delkfutt's Tower using the Survival Guide teleportation,
  Outpost warp, or Home Point warp.
- You will now likely need to climb to the 10th floor of Delkfutt's
  Tower in order to gain a in order to access the Basement of the Tower:

Obtaining Delkfutt Key Short Way

This is the shortest route. You may be Tractored through the door to the
Basement at Lower Delkfutt's Tower (E-8) Map 1 without the Key if a
party member already has it.

- Next, you can open the door at (J-8).
- Click it to travel to Upper Delkfutt's Tower. Walk forward then click
  the ??? at the bottom of the stairs to be teleported directly to:
- Porphyrion, kill this NM then trade the it drops to the Elevator
  directly beside it.
- After using the elevator, proceed down the spiral stair case for two
  zones, through the Cermet Door in Map 5 at (I-9) Upper Delkfutt's
  Tower.
- Skip to the \"Finishing the Mission\" section below.

Obtaining Delkfutt Key Long Way

This process involves a multi-zone, ten-floor run up the entire tower.
Expect the climb up alone to take roughly 15 minutes. If you are below
level 50, consider bringing the following:
*Sneak/Invisible (Status) or / .
*Some form of Reraise and Warp is also helpful.
Set your Home Point in Jeuno if you plan on warping out after the
Mission.

- A map of Qufim Island and a Map of Delkfutt's Tower may be purchased
  from Promurouve at (H-7) in Lower Jeuno (inside the building) or
  Rusese at (H-6) in Upper Jeuno for 3,000 Gil each.
- Make your way to Port Jeuno and zone into Qufim Island.
- Enter Lower Delkfutt's Tower at (F-6).
- Once inside prepare for a long walk. Bats and Dancing Weapons will

  - Enter and follow the right wall until you reach the stairs at
    (E/F-6).
- Floor 2:
  - Follow the left wall until you reach the stairs at (I-9).
- Floor 3:
  - Follow the right wall until you reach the Teleporter at (G-6).
- Floor 4: (Middle Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)
  - Follow the right wall past 2 Teleporters and go up the stairs at
    (J-6).
- Floor 5: (half way there)
  - Enter the door into a hallway on your right at (I-7) then follow the
    left wall until you see a stairway leading north at (H-10).
- Floor 6:
  - At the top of the stairs follow the right wall to a Teleporter at
    (J-10).
- Floor 7:
  - In this big room head north-west to a stairway at (G-7).
- Floor 8:
  - Follow the left wall to another stairway at (J-7).
- Floor 9:
  - Head south to a stairway that leads back down at (J-10).
- Floor 8: (again)
  - Head west to a stairway leading back up at (G-10). Do not fall down
    the hole in the floor!

  - Follow the left wall until you reach a Teleporter at (F-6).
- Floor 10: (Upper Delkfutt's Tower Map 1)
  - When you zone in head through the door to the south-east and down a
    hallway. You will find a door on your right at (H-7). This door is
    guarded by Mimas, a Gigas NM that uses Hundred Fists.
  - After killing Mimas and clearing the hallway enter the door at (H-7)
    into a large room. This room will be filled with Gigas and a NM
    named Porphyrion.
    - Try to pull Porphyrion out into the hallway without linking any of
      the other Gigas. Summoner or a high level helper is useful for
      this.
- Kill Porphyrion and any aggro you may have. Porphyrion will drop 6  s.
  If you need more then 6 you will have to wait 10 minutes for him to
  re-pop.
  - After defeating Porphyrion, you may choose to head up two more
    floors to reach the Home Point on the twelfth floor. This will save
    you from having to ever do this climb again. Be advised that higher
    floors will contain enemies that are level 65+ and will aggro.
- Once you have your Key, trade it to the elevator on the floor at (H-8)
  inside Porphyrion's room to use the elevator and afterwards it will
  convert to a Delkfutt key.
- Walk down the LONG staircase after using the elevator to get to the
  Basement.

Finishing the Mission

- Once you reach the Basement head east into a large room and interact
  with the door at (L-7) with your newly obtained Delkfutt key for a
  cutscene.
  - If you do not get the cutscene you are probably at the wrong door.
- Return to the Windurstian Embassy in Ru'Lude Gardens, let Pakh
  Jatalfih acknowledge your return then click the Door: Windurstian Emb.
  for a cutscene to complete the Mission.
  - This is the 3rd door inside the embassy building. There are multiple
    doors with the same name.

Beadeaux (Prerequisite)

Note: This prerequisite can be done either before or after the Davoi and
Castle Oztroja sections of this mission. It's up to you whether you want
to get the requisite Key Items now, or in concert with the Beadeaux
section.

- Mages will need Echo Drops for this area.
  - Beadeaux has a gimmick whereby you must inflict Silence upon
    yourself when passing through certain sections to stop yourself
    being Cursed, Curse will decrease your HP/MP and cause you to walk
    slower.
- Everything in this area aggros sound, therefore only Sneak is
  necessary.
- Set your Home Point in Jeuno and bring some form of Warp. (You may
  purchase Scroll of Instant Warp from the Conquest NPC under Common
  all-rank items for 10 points.)
- You will have to kill two level 40-45 NM in this zone. Having trusts
  summoned before applying Sneak and heading out is recommended.
- Enter Beadeaux from Pashhow Marshlands at (L-11).
  - If you have a high level helper it is easier at this point to send
    them ahead to kill the NM's and then just lot the drops. If this is
    the case you can head back to Jeuno as soon as you have both items.
  - You may also consider leveling to 60 (which is most likely your
    current cap).
- Follow the left wall to a tunnel at (H-7).
- Inside follow the right wall until you get to a Mute device inside a
  circular room. The Mute has an effervescent glow and appears like a
  huge mushroom. Click this device and it will silence you. This will
  allow you to pass the up coming Afflictor without being Cursed.
- Head south after you have been silenced and then follow the tunnel
  west until you reach the exit at (F-8).
- Outside reapply silence at the Mute in front of you (There is another
  Afflictor in this area) and then head southwest to a ramp at (E-10).
- Once you are on the upper area turn right and go across the bridge.
  Follow this path across a second and a third bridge then remove your
  silence. Follow the right wall here until you reach (H-9/10).
- Here you will find De'Vyu Headhunter. He is a Warrior NM. He will drop
  the Quadav Charm.
- Now turn around and head northwest back toward where you came from.
- Follow the right wall now until you reach (F-6).
- Here you will find Go'Bhu Gascon, another Warrior NM. He will drop the
  other required item, Quadav Augury Shell.
- Head back to Jeuno.
- Trade both items to Sattal-Mansal.
  - These must be traded separately through the use of two trades.
  - If you trade him both items at once you will not get both of the KIs
    you need to open the door in the Qulun Dome. The second item will
    still be in your inventory.

Magicites

Davoi Magicite

This part of the mission can be soloed but a group or high level help
will make death less likely.
You will need to reach the Monastic Cavern in Davoi. Davoi is located in
Jugner Forest (G-12).

- Make your way to Davoi.
  - Survival Guide is fastest.
- Once you've entered, head to (G-7).
  - There will be two Orcs here - either kill them or sneak past them.
- Drop invisible and click on the Wall of Dark Arts, you'll be able to
  enter the Monastic Cavern.
  - If you aggro the Orcs you can quickly run through the Wall to the
    zone a few feet ahead.
- Inside there will not be any enemies. Walk down the path into a large
  room and inspect the Magicite to obtain the Magicite: Optistone.

Maps

Castle Oztroja Magicite

This part of the Mission can be soloed but a group or high level help is
highly recommended.

- You will need both s and s.
- There are areas of this zone where anyone under Level 60 will still
  receive aggro.

You will need to reach the Altar Room in Castle Oztroja. The Castle is
located in Meriphataud Mountains (L-8).

- Enter the Castle and head to the Brass Door at (I-8). You will see a
  lever at either side of the door. One lever will open the door and the
  other will open a trap in the floor and cause you to fall into a pit.
  There is a very easy way to open this door:
  - Stand between the two levers in front of the door, click one of the
    levers and immediately run back.
  - If it is the trapped lever there is some lag between when the lever
    is clicked and when the trap door opens. If the door opens run
    through, if the trap opens wait for it to close and then use the
    other lever.
  - The game is very picky about where you stand to hit the lever. You
    may have to move around a bit until you don't see the \"Target is out
    of Range\" message.
- Proceed upstairs, you'll be on Map 2. Head to (G-7) where you will
  exit into a courtyard in Map 6.
- On this map, head north (without falling off) to a hallway entrance at
  (I-7) which will lead you to Map 7.
- Here follow the right wall until you reach a door at (H-9).
  - The mobs in this area are much higher level then the ones previously
    encountered.
- At the door, light the Torch and you will be taken through.
- Head south and take a right to another Brass Door. Click on the door
  to open it.
  - The zone is just beyond this door so run like hell if you have
    aggro.
- Inside you will be in the Altar Room, an area with no mobs. Click on
  the Magicite to receive the Magicite: Orastone.

Note: If the cutscene did not trigger, and you received a message that
the \"magicite glows ominously,\" then try the following:

- Go back to Upper Jeuno, trigger the cutscene with Paya-Sabya, go to
  Lower Jeuno, and trigger the cutscene with Muckvix to receive Yagudo
  torch.
- Go back to Altar Room for an initial cutscene with Fickie, and then a
  subsequent cutscene when touching the magicite.
- Seems that the Yagudo torch portion is required, even if someone else
  can get you through.

Beadeaux Magicite

You will need to reach the Qulun Dome in Beadeaux. Beadeaux is located
in Pashhow Marshlands (L-11).

- Everything in this area aggros sound, therefore only Sneak is
  necessary.
- From the entrance of Beadeaux, hug the left wall until you reach a
  tunnel entrance at (H-7).
- Make your way down the tunnel and once you reach the intersection, go
  left. You'll zone into Qulun Dome.
- There are no monsters in here. Investigate the Door to open it. Inside
  you'll the find the Magicite, click it to obtain the Magicite:

  - If you are low level, you might want to use Trusts or form a party
    of lvl 50+ players.
- Go to Fei'Yin (located in the northeast corner of Beaucedine Glacier)
  for a cutscene with Zeid. You will have to reach the Qu'Bia Arena and
  clear the BCNM \"The Rank 5 Mission\".
  - The majority of enemies in Fei'Yin detect by sound, however there
    are several that detect spellcasting.
  - Quick Travel options:
    - Home Point #1 to Fei'Yin is the fastest way, it puts you right at
      the zone to Qu'Bia Arena.
    - Unity Warp (Level 128) will place you at the entrance of Fei'Yin.
    - Unity Warp (Level 125) will place you in the central area of
      Beaucedine Glacier.

    - Go east to (K-8). There are 2 Dolls in front of a door named
      Cermet Portal, open it and you'll be able to enter Qu'Bia Arena.

You will be able to prepare outside of the BC, however all buffs will
wear upon entering. Plan accordingly and click the Burning Circle when
ready.

- You only need to kill the Archlich to win.
- You will be facing Archlich Taber'quoan. The Archlich will spawn with
  2 Ancient Sorcerers. Ancient Warriors will also spawn in the hallway
  and run into the arena to help the Archlich during the fight.
  - The Archlich is a BLM, and will cast spells like Sleepga II and
    Freeze, he may also use Manafont.
  - The lesser skeletons have very little HP and can be easily taken out
    by an AoE spell.
  - Focus attacks on the Archlich, a Paladin with Invincible is useful
    for managing the many extra mobs. A Monk using Hundred Fists also
    shines in this fight, due to the skeleton blunt penalty.
- When you win, you'll be given another cutscene and receive Burnt seal.

You can head back to the Heavens Tower.

Navigation

[]

Castle Zvahl Baileys

- Head for Xarcabard. Castle Zvahl is on the far west of the area at
  (D-7/8).
- Enter Castle Zvahl Baileys, follow the one-way path until you come to
  the first intersection. Turn right, head north then west and down a
  small flight of stairs.
- Turn left and follow the right wall until you reach the next map.
- On the next map, turn right and head all the way to the top right
  corner of the map.
- Head up the stairs and you will be on the second \"level\".
- Next, get to the top left part of the map and walk back down the set
  of stairs and you'll be back on the first \"level\".
- Work your way into the center of the map from here and you will be in
  an outdoor courtyard. Go back up to the second \"level\" then through
  the gate on the right and you'll be in a long hall with a large flight
  of stairs.

Castle Zvahl Keep

- Inside, walk out of the hallway and turn right. Ahead, you will have
  to go through a few gates, there are a lot of mobs in the area which
  detect sight, however your party should have no problems disposing of
  them.
- Once on the second level, you will be overlooking a room below. Follow
  the narrow path to more stairs and another hallway. You'll eventually
  reach an area with teleporters. These teleporters take awhile to
  activate, so just stand on the center and be patient. Using them will
  cause your Invisible (Status) to drop.
- Follow the teleporters four times until you reach a new map. Run to
  the west/middle of this area and you'll see a door. Passing through
  this door will result in a zone to the Throne Room.

BCNM Fight

You will now have some time to prepare for the fight, run to the other
side of the Throne Room and gather up. When ready, check the door and
enter the BCNM.

- The Shadow Lord has 2 forms. In the first form, he can switch between
  physical or magical immunity. Take time during magic immunity to rest
  MP, and hold off on melee attacks while in physical.
- While immune to magic, he will use Dark Nova (AOE Darkness damage) and
  can cast Black Magic. Dark Nova tends to indicate that he will switch
  to physical immunity.
- During physical immunity, he can use a variety of TP attacks,
  including Giga Slash, Kick Back and Umbra Smash.
- Defeating the first form will get you a cutscene. You will immediately
  be returned to the fight. Rest quickly and get ready for the second
  form.
- The second form will only use AoE attacks, but has less HP
  (approximately 4,000 HP). At this point, use your 2hrs and take him
  down as fast as possible. Curaga should be used liberally here to help
  counter the AoE damage. He will not rotate immunities like the first
  form.

| - Due to the long nature of this mission, it is recommended that you     |
|   take precautions to ensure that you have received the key items. This  |
|   mission can take a while, as it requires travel to a lot of different  |
|   places, some in the far corners of large and dangerous zones. Always   |
|   ensure that when checking a headstone you receive the message that you |
|   obtained the key item.                                                 |
| - If you are too far away the game can give you the message, \"You need   |
|   to move closer to key item\" and at a quick glance this can appear the  |
|   same as you acquiring it. Be sure to double check.                     |
| - There are two types of headstones, one type only gives the key item,   |
|   others spawn NMs that you must defeat before you may receive the key   |
|   item.                                                                  |

|     fall off the cliffs, and head up.                                    |
|   - Once you get to about (I-6), go south.                               |
|   - Continue on until (H-9) and you'll see a tunnel going west, the zone |
|     is not far ahead, bringing you back out to La Theine Plateau.        |
|     - If you don't have the Geomagnetic-Fount, it will be on the right   |
|       on a ledge after zoning to the Plateau. Get close to it and        |
|       interact with it from below to register it.                        |

|     middle exit, and you'll end up on Map 7.                             |
|   - From Map 7, hug the left wall and head out the exit at (D-12) to     |
|     continue to Map 5.                                                   |
|   - On Map 5, head for (J-8), the only other exit, to get to Map 2.      |
|     There is a around (H-6)/(H-7). Either wait it out, or trade an Ice   |
|     Cluster. Waiting it out is safer, but can take extra time.           |
|   - On Map 2, run to (E-7) while hugging the left wall, and you'll be    |
|     back on Map 7. Do not accidentally take the drop that is to the      |

|     Jungle. There are two on the way.                                    |

|     sound. During night time, however, it is True Sound.                 |
|     - Take care when passing it, as it will mostly likely spell a wipe   |
|       for your party.                                                    |
| - Once outside, gather everyone up and head for the tunnel under the     |
|   waterfall at (K-7). The headstone is located around (L-6)/(L-7). Check |

[]

- Head to the Cutter, which is located at (H-8) on Map 5 of Arrapago
  Reef.

Survival Guide route

- The faster route, provided you already have the teleport unlocked.
  - Requires running through most of Arrapago Reef.
- Take the Survival Guide to Caedarva Mire and run south to zone into
  Arrapago Reef at (G-8).
  - Note this is NOT the (G-6) zone to Arrapago Reef just east of where
    you teleport in from the Survival Guide
- After zoning, head south to (H-8 on Map 5) to find the Cutter.

Staging Point route

- Travel to Dvucca Isle Staging Point.
  - Requires an Imperial Silver Piece (or just 200 Standing) to reach if
    your Assault Rank is lower than Captain. See directions here.
  - You may instead walk to this Staging Point from the teleport to
    Nyzul Isle Staging Point if you prefer. Take the northwest
    teleporter at (G-8) out to Arrapago Remnants, then the west teleport
    from there, and exit.

  mission before) need an Ephramadian gold coin to enter the
  battlefield.
  - If you need another gold coin, examine Jazaraat's Headstone at
    Caedarva Mire (E-10).
- Gessho will assist you in this fight.
  - Gessho will wait a minute or two before he begins to fight. This
    gives your party a little time to buff.
  - The fight will continue in the event Gessho is killed.
- The battle is against the Ashu Talif Crew which consists of 2x
  Rangers, 2x Red Mages, and 1x Corsair.
  - The Ashu Talif Crew seem to be resistant to most forms of sleep
    unless Elemental Seal is used first.
  - Lullaby was easily landed in Item Level 119 equipment.
- Once the five Ashu Talif Crew members are defeated, another four will
  take their place.
- The Ashu Talif Captain will spawn along with the others.
- You must bring the Ashu Talif Captain's health to approximately 20% to
  win the battle.
- After the fight, you will wind up in Nashmau.
  - Players who have already completed this mission will end up back at
    the Cutter instead.

Walkthrough

- Take the Supplies package to any one of the Staging Points (with the
  exception of Nyzul Isle Staging Point and the Aht Urhgan Whitegate
  portal, Chamber of Passage), and talk to the NPC stationed there to
  complete delivery.
  - Once you're at a staging point, be sure to do the delivery first to
    the nearby NPC, as interacting with the Runic Portal will teleport
    you directly back to Aht Urhgan Whitegate, and you will not be
    allowed to use the Chamber of Passage to return yet.
  - Visit the Staging Points page by clicking here and then click on one
    of the Runic Portal Names for detailed steps on reaching one of
    these locations. You will eventually want them all, so pick any of
    them.
    - Note for returners and new players: there's now another quick way
      to initially get to Nashmau (without taking the Ferry or
      navigating Alzadaal teleporters) via a Voidwatch Warp easily
      available to most players using the Caedarva Mire destination.
      (There's no easily unlockable Unity warp for that purpose!)
      - At H-10 in Aht Urhgan Whitegate there's a tunnel on the first
        floor where you'll find an Ironbound Gate, which leads outside
        to Wajaom Woodlands Postern where you can talk to Camille to
        Participate in Voidwatch Ops. You don't need to have done any
        other part of Voidwatch at all - you just need to be level 75
        and be Rank 3 in your home nation.
      - After receiving the Amber stratum abyssite, you can now use any
        Atmacite Refiner (in the Present) to warp to these locations
        initially to unlock other Home Points, Survival Guides, and
        Staging Points (hence the inclusion in this section!)... you'll
        just need 1000 cruor.
      - If you don't have cruor from Abyssea, you can exchange 1 copper
        voucher from a Sparks NPC for the fee – and in Southern San
        d'Oria or Bastok Markets this is right next to the Atmacite
        Refiner at those locations.
      - And, from the Atmacite Refiner, do
        Request Teleportation –> Aht Urhgan. –> Caedarva Mire., and
        you'll be just outside the east entrance of Nashmau. Walk inside
        to grab the Survival Guide and the Home Point and continue your
        journey.
      - From here, the Azouph Isle Staging Point is very close with a
        mount. You can use either the east or north exit from Nashmau to
        get there.
- After you've delivered the Supplies package to the blue-clad Immortal
  NPC nearby, use the Runic Portal at the Staging Point to return to Aht
  Urhgan Whitegate.

Battle 1

- The first fight is against Amnaf and 4x Imperial Gears.
  - The gears will not spawn until Amnaf is aggro'd.
  - The gears can be slept, but not very easily. They are however,
    susceptible to both Gravity and Bind.
  - Amnaf can be slept.
  - Naja will pick one of the enemies at random to fight.
- Once defeated, Amnaf will warp one room over.
- Naja will wait for a bit before heading into the next room.

Battle 2

- The second fight is once again against Amnaf and 4x Imperial Gears
  (Triple Gears).
  - The gears are much easier to sleep this time.
- Naja will pick one of the enemies at random to fight.

- Defeat Amnaf to finish the BC.

  completes this mission.

Walkthrough

- Check the blank target at the Nyzul Isle Staging Point for a cutscene.
- Head to the Runic Seal (I-9) to enter the battlefield.
- The time limit for this fight is 45 minutes.
  - This fight was initially capped at level 75. Level 99 players should
    have little to no difficulty with it.
  - Trusts can be summoned in this fight.
- This fight is broken into three separate battles.

Battle 1 (Raubahn)

- Raubahn re-raises twice during this fight, meaning you must defeat him
  three times to move on.
- He has access to all Blue Mage spells and abilities.
- Each time he re-raises, his job abilities, including his Azure Lore
  timer are reset.
- He seems to favor the spell Eyes On Me and will cast it often.
  - The damage from this spell goes up considerably when parred with
    Azure Lore, doing well over 1,000 damage.
- Every time he uses Azure Lore he will follow it up with Eyes On Me.
- He has access to sword Weapon Skills.
  - Mages should be especially careful of his Circle Blade.
- The final time he re-raises, he will have an immunity to either melee,
  magic, or ranged damage.
  - The immunity is determined by what form of damage you used to deal
    the most damage to him. If you used mostly melee damage for the
    first 2 rounds, he will be immune to melee in the third round, ect.
  - If you mix the type of damage you deal, i.e. magic round one and
    melee round 2, he will have no immunity the third round, but he will
    have increased defense.

Battle 2 (Razfahd)

- He is unable to move at all during the fight.
- He is a Paladin type monster and has access to Banish IV, Banishga
  III, Dia III, and Holy II.
- At 50% HP he uses Perfect Defense and becomes immune to all forms of
  damage for a short time.

Battle 3 (Alexander)

- This part of the battle is likely to take the longest to finish so
  plan accordingly.
- Like Razfahd he cannot move at all during the fight.
- He is a Paladin type monster and has access to Banish IV, Banishga
  III, Dia III, and Holy II and Mega Holy.
- He has access to the following abilities:
  - Draw In: Used only when the person with hate moves too far away.
  - Radiant Sacrament: AoE and wipes Utsusemi. Additional Effect: Magic
    Defense Down.
  - Void of Repentance: Terrorizes target.
  - Gospel of the Lost: Heals for around 900-1100 HP and removes
    debuffs.
    - This move can be stunned, but it has a very quick casting time.
  - Divine Spear: Damage + additional effect of attack -25%.
  - Divine Judgement: AoE 1000+ damage and clears Utsusemi. He will use
    this ability at 50% of his HP and several times again as his health
    decreases. He will say \"ΩΩΩΩΩΩΩ\" just before using this move.
  - Perfect Defense: He becomes immune to all forms of damage for a
    short time.
- The battle is over once Alexander is defeated.

- If you fail this fight, return to Naja Salaheem for another key item
  to try again.
- If you win this fight, you'll watch one last cutscene that finishes
  this mission.

Cost

The price for changing allegiance to another Nation is dependent on that
Nation's rank in the Conquest:

  Place   Cost
  ------- ------------
  1st     40,000 Gil
  2nd     12,000 Gil
  3rd     4,000 Gil

Notes

- If you have a Mission active from your current Nation, you will not be
  able to change allegiances.
- If you are Rank 5 in any Nation, even if you do not have an active
  Mission, you will not be able to change allegiances. Instead, you will
  be told your Nation is in trouble and your application can not be
  accepted.
  - However, if you talk to your Nation's representative and decline to
    start Mission 5-1 or 5-2 you can change Nations.
- The first time you switch to a Nation, you'll be Rank 1 with no
  Conquest Points in that Nation.
  - If you return to a Nation, you have the previous Rank and Conquest
    Points from that Nation reinherited.
- Any rewards from Missions done in other Nations are retained when you
  switch.
  - For example, you will keep your Airship Pass and Dynamis access.
  - Repeating 'all Nations' type Missions such as Delkfutt > Fei Yin for
    different Nations will result in a Gil reward instead of the
    original Key Items.
- You forfeit previously allowed access to Chateau d'Oraguille, Heavens
  Tower stairwell, or the President's Office in the Bastok Metalworks
  when you change Nations.
  - If you switch back you will retain the previously allowed access.
- Players may use the teleport service to teleport to any outpost for
  which they have completed a supply Mission, regardless of their
  current Nation of allegiance.

Walkthrough

- In the last mission you had been asked to go to a nearby Allied
  fortress, one of the three dungeons near Jeuno: Garlaige Citadel (S),
  Crawlers' Nest (S), or The Eldieme Necropolis (S).
  It is there you can pick up a recommendation letter that is required
  to join the Allied Campaign.
- There are three potential recommendation letters that may all be
  obtained, but you may only be allied to one nation at a time.
- Your choice of nation allegiance has no impact on the mission
  progression.
  - After you've joined a nation, you can do any of the three nation's
    quests to progress the missions or even do all three in parallel.
    Joining a nation doesn't require you to do that nation's quests and
    the contents of the quests don't change based on your allegiance.
  - The nation you join will charge less for their Allied Notes items.
    Due to their new alliance, Allied Notes can be redeemed at any
    vendor in any nation but buying from other nations has a 50% markup.
  - Your allied nation determines the destination of the Retrace /
    Instant Retrace spell.
  - It doesn't matter for anything relevant.

Delivering the Letter

- You will have to take at least one these recommendation letters to a
  town by crossing through several Shadowreign areas.

:*Most of the maps in-game will appear the same as they do in the
present and will not display any differences, such as new zone lines.
The paths are as follows:

:* San d'Oria:

::*Batallia Downs (S) -> northern Jugner Forest (S) -> Vunkerl Inlet (S)
-> southern Jugner Forest (S) -> East Ronfaure (S).

:* Windurst:

::*Sauromugue Champaign (S) -> Meriphataud Mountains (S) -> Fort
Karugo-Narugo (S) -> West Sarutabaruta (S).

:* Bastok:

::*Rolanberry Fields (S) -> Pashhow Marshlands (S) -> Grauberg (S) ->
North Gustaberg (S).

- Note: At this point, the maps of Vunkerl Inlet (S), Fort Karugo-Narugo
  (S), and Grauberg (S) will be absent. (These maps are obtainable from
  the Magical Map Vendors for 30k Gil in the present, or may be
  obtainable for only 3000 gil from the vendors in the past/Shadowreign
  areas. Currently confirmed for Map of Fort Karugo-Narugo.)

:*They may be obtained from quests within the area of the three Allied
fortresses and do not require any sort of fighting.

::*These quests are, respectively: The Flipside of Things (Vunkerl), The
Weekly Adventurer (Fort Karugo-Narugo), and Lost in Translocation
(Grauberg).

- Once you reach one of the capitals, you will have to prove your worth
  to whatever faction you intend on joining. After arriving at the
  nation you wish to support, proceed to the section below on this page
  called \"Follow-Up Quests\".

:*Allegiance is not dependent on the present. The recommendation letter
will be taken and an initial quest will have to be completed.

::*Once this is done, you will need to complete two more quests. The
initial quest can be canceled and the recommendation letter returned.

:*Completing the initial quest will switch your allegiance. Unlike
manually switching your allegiance, there is no penalty or cost and no
restriction.

::*If you wanted to complete all three quest, simply do them in a
fashion that places your permanent nation last.

:::*The two follow-up quests from any nation can be done once any single
initial quest has been completed and are optional.

    Canal.

BCNM

If you use the Enternity/FastCS addon, the following cutscenes may not
play while using Windower or Ashita. If you are running the game at 60
FPS, you may have to revert to 30 FPS to complete this cutscene.

- Commands to unload them: //lua u enternity - /addon unload enternity -
  //lua unload fastcs - //config FrameRateDivisor 2
- If you crash the game after completing the BCNM, the top door will not
  provide a cutscene. The remedy is to click the blank, glowing spot
  right outside of Heavens Tower to complete Rank 10.
- Not everyone has this issue but if you do the above should work for
  you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The BCNM fight is trivial at 99. Trusts can be summoned.

- The first part is against four Ace Cardians:
  - A good strategy is to cast Sleepga on them and and kill Ace of
    Batons (BLM) → Ace of Swords (PLD) → Ace of Coins (RDM). Sleep Ace
    of Cups (WHM) and rest to full.
  - The Cardians will eventually start resisting Sleep. However, unless
    you take a long time to kill the first three it should not be a
    problem.
  - The Cardians will aggro from outside casting player casting range.
    The Ace of Swords will move to melee range while the other three
    will cast before moving.
  - As soon as the last Cardian dies you will get a cutscene.
- The next fight is with a Wyvern and a Manticore.
  - You will be assisted by Ajido-Marujido. If he dies, you lose the
    fight, so be sure to cure him. Kill what Ajido-Marujido decides to
    fight first.
  - Letting Ajido-Marujido choose will aggro both NMs. Be prepared to
    pull both off of him.

*Optional: Talk to Kupipi for optional dialogue which will change once
you've reached Rank 10.

- - Everyone else upstairs has new lines again, but they won't change
    after completion of the mission.
- Return to the Door: Vestal Chamber in Heavens Tower for a cutscene.

Once you are part of a mercenary company, the Empire will issue you
Imperial Army I.D. Tags. Each tag will allow you to attempt a single
Assault Mission.

- The tags will be held in reserve by Rytaal at the Commissions Agency
  until you speak to him to retrieve a tag.
- You may only redeem one tag at a time. Complete a mission and return
  to Rytaal before attempting to redeem another tag.
- If Rytaal is holding less than 3 tags in reserve (4 for Captains), the
  Empire will issue a new ID tag every 24 hours (Earth Time) after the
  first tag was redeemed.
  - Completing Rhapsodies of Vanadiel Mission 1-16 and receiving the Key
    Item \"Rhapsody in Azure\" will allow ID tags to refresh every 10
    mins.
- You are able to hold 1 tag and at the same time allow Rytaal to store
  up your maximum number of tags.

When you have a Imperial Army I.D. Tag, you may sign up for a mission by
talking to the NPCs at the desks in the lower area of the agency, who
will offer you missions based on your Assault Rank. Select a mission and
you will receive Assault Orders in exchange for the tag. Assault Orders
will permit you to enter the assault, and will also allow you to use the
Runic Portal to travel to your assault destination without a Runic
portal use permit.

A party must fulfill these conditions to initiate an assault mission:

- All players in the party must be level 50 or above.
- All players in the party, at the Runic Portal must have the same
  Assault Orders.
- The party must be between 1 and 6 people.
  - Any characters which disconnect during the entry procedure will
    count towards this limit, but they will fail to enter the zone and
    their Assault Orders will not be used.

The party must designate a single member to assume the lead for the
mission. To assume the lead, talk to the Imperial Guard at the Staging
Point. 50 Imperial Standing can be exchanged for an Assault Armband
which can be used to lead the mission.

Once the party is prepared, the designated leader initiates the mission
by interacting with the Runic Seal. After selecting parameters, any
party members in the vicinity of the Runic Seal will be automatically
transported to the assault location and their Assault Orders will be
marked as used.

- Used Assault Orders will still allow you to use the Runic Portal
  freely, but cannot be used to enter another assault mission.

Caution: Players in other zones or a large distance from the Seal will
not be transported. Please ensure all your party members are nearby
before initiating the mission.

- Note: As of the December 2013 Version Update, players are now able to
  enter without any other party members. Due to the nature of some
  Assault Missions, it may be very difficult to win all objectives while
  solo.

Winning and Losing

Upon entry to the assault location, a timer will start, and the party
will be informed of the time limit for the mission. The party must
trigger the Rune of Release before the time limit is exhausted or the
mission will be a failure.

Each assault mission has a unique set of objectives which must be
accomplished before the Rune of Release will spawn. Completing these
objectives will cause the Rune of Release to spawn. The party is free to
continue the assault mission after the Rune spawns, and in some cases
will be rewarded for further efforts. However, the party must be careful
to trigger the Rune before the time limit expires, because if they do
not, the mission will be a failure even if all objectives are met.

Upon successful completion of the mission, each party member will be
rewarded with Assault Points. The amount of assault points varies
depending on mission, and in some cases the party can receive penalties
for poor performance during the mission.

- Each mission has a base value of AP which will be rewarded to each
  player (see table below).
  - The table shows the maximum AP earnable per person for a party of 3
    people.
  - In some missions, AP penalties will be assessed for underperforming
    (for example, capturing only 4 of the 5 Fairy Apkallu during Apkallu
    Seizure)
  - For any mission except First Lieutenant missions, bringing
    additional party members will reduce the base value by 10% per
    additional party member beyond 3.
  - For First Lieutenant missions, the amount of AP rewarded is static
    regardless of party size.
- Each participant will receive the same base value regardless of their
  actual contribution during the Assault.
- Players will receive an individual 50% AP bonus if this was the first
  time they successfully completed the mission.
- The designated leader will receive a 10% AP bonus if the mission was a
  success.
  - This 10% bonus is cumulative with the first-time bonus as well.
    Thus, a leader who wins the assault for the first time will receive
    165% of the base value.
- In the event that the party failed the mission, each party member
  instead receives 100 Assault Points. No leader or first-time bonuses
  are awarded.

Ranking Up

If an assault is completed successfully, each member earns 1 Rank-Up
Point. If that is the first time completing that Assault, the player
will receive an additional 4 Rank-Up Points, for a total of 5.

You can check which assaults you have completed by checking your menu
under \"Missions\", there will be a separate tab labeled \"Assaults\" that
will display current and completed assaults.

    

After a player has collected 25 or more Rank-Up Points, they may start a
promotion quest from either Abquhbah or Naja Salaheem to improve their
standing within her mercenary company.

- Alternatively upon reaching the pre-requisite number of 25+ points
  players may skip each quest by spending 1,000 gil to buy the key item
  ranks from a Curio Vendor Moogle after the player has obtained the
  \"Rhapsody in Azure\" from Rhapsodies of Vanadiel Missions.

    

Rank-up points can be checked by talking to Abquhbah and clicking the
Mercenary Assessments option.

    

After ranking up, any excess rank-up points beyond 25 are lost, and the
player must accumulate another 25 rank-up points to gain another
promotion.

Ranking up to Captain

Unlike the other ranks, the Captain Promotion does not rely upon rank-up
points. Instead, this quest is offered once a mercenary has successfully
completed all 50 main assaults and all of the Treasures of Aht Urhgan
Missions. Players initially enter their mercenary company at Private
Second Class, and through successful completion of assault missions can
rise as high as Captain.

Having the Captain rank confers certain benefits:

- Rytaal will reserve a 4th tag.
  - This happens without the Promotion: Captain quest being started or
    completed. Immediately after finishing the 50th assault and then
    speaking to Rytaal he will speak of the new ID.
- Runic Portal permits cost 0 Imperial Standing.
- Access to Alzadaal Undersea Ruins no longer costs a 1 Imperial Silver
  Piece fee.
- The ability to begin building a Mythic Weapon.

Assault Point Rewards

As mercenaries complete Assault Missions, they will accumulate Assault
Points. Points are specific to each Assault area and cannot be
transferred or combined.

As a way to recognize the contributions of mercenaries, the Empire
offers to exchange rare and powerful items for Assault Points in each
zone.

- Mercenaries can also exchange 500 AP from any one Assault area for a
  Remnants Permit (used for Salvage) from Zasshal outside of the
  Commissions Agency. The Empire implores you not to participate in the
  Assault Point black-market.

Additional Assault Missions

Nyzul Isle

Instead of taking on the specific objectives laid out by the Empire in
the other five traditional assault areas, players may also accept
commissions to investigate the mysterious Nyzul Isle for the opportunity
to acquire rewards unique to these assaults. Like other assault
missions, accepting a commission for Nyzul Isle Investigation (set up
for level 75 players) or Nyzul Isle Uncharted Area Survey (set up for
level 99 players) requires an Imperial Army I.D. Tag. There is no
minimum Assault Rank requirement and Assault Points are not awarded for
completion, although Nyzul Isle does have its own unique credit system
in the form of Nyzul Tokens which can be used to purchase temporary
items within the assault area.

Also like other assault missions, players receive 1 rank-up point per
successful investigation (and an extra 4 for the first time the zone is
completed), as long as the party leaves Nyzul by choosing to leave
rather than letting the time limit expire.

To accept commissions for either of these assaults, speak to Sorrowful
Sage in the Commissions Agency. Further details on Nyzul Isle can be
found at the Nyzul Isle Investigation and Nyzul Isle Uncharted Area
Survey pages.

Monthly Adventurer Campaigns

There is one type of campaign that may run any given month.

Ashu Talif Assault

After completing Aht Urhgan Mission 18 (Passing Glory), Halshaob in
Nashmau (H-10) will seek to hire accomplished mercenaries in order to
investigate the Ashu Talif.

There are three repeatable assaults:

- Scouting the Ashu Talif
- Royal Painter Escort
- Targeting the Captain

Note: You can only undertake one assault per Earth day and Ashu Talif
Assaults do not require an Imperial Army I.D. Tag and do not reward
players with Assault Points or Rank-Up Points.

- Zone into La Vaule (S).
  - Next mission automatically begins at end of cutscene.

Directions to La Vaule (S)

- The fastest way is to take the Survival Guide teleport to Jugner
  Forest (S) and then zone into La Vaule (S) at (G-11).
  - Taking a Recall-Jugner is the second-best option, if you got the KI.
  - The Jugner Forest (S) campaign warp is also fast, if you have some
    allied notes. The warp is unlocked upon entering Jugner from the
    Batallia zone line.
- Otherwise, you'll have to zone into Vunkerl Inlet (S) at (L-6).
  - Coming from Batallia Downs (S) just stick to the left when you zone
    in.
  - Coming from East Ronfaure (S) you'll need to head south and cross
    the water at (H-6). From there, make your way to (I/J-8) and fall
    down the one way ramp. Head north towards Batallia Downs (S) and
    veer east around (K-5) to make your way to (L-6).
  - There's a one way drop at (F-6), so you'll have to take the eastern
    path towards (H-7).
  - Make your way down to (D-10) to zone back into Jugner Forest (S).
  - Head north and fall off the ramp at (J-11). Proceed to (I-9) where
    you'll cross some fallen logs and continue north-west.
  - You'll hit a bend at (G-8), and begin moving south-east past the
    Telepoint at (H-9) before turning south.
  - You'll see a split at (H-11). Keep to the right (away from the
    river).
  - Grab the Survival Guide on your way to the Wooden Gate at (G-11)
    which will take you into La Vaule (S).

- Examine the Reinforced Gateway at (F-9) in La Vaule (S) for a
  cutscene.
- Examine the Reinforced Gateway a second time for a BCNM fight against
  Galarhigg.
  - All buffs will wear upon entering.
    - If you are using Trusts, summon them after entering.
- After defeating the boss, another cutscene occurs and you
  automatically advance to the next mission.

Directions to Reinforced Gateway

- Once inside La Vaule (S), enter the big room at (J-7) and proceed west
  until you reach (I-7).
- From (I-7), go north then proceed west until you reach (G-7). From
  (G-7), head north. Once you reach (G-6), turn immediately left.
- Make your way directly across the big room filled with orcs (they're
  around level 80) until you reach (E-6).
  - Be careful of Coinbiter Cjaknokk, who has true sight. The other orcs
    will link if he aggros you, so keep a wide berth and work your way
    around him if he's up.
- Once you reach (E-6) follow the path north, then turn left and head
  west. Follow this path until (E-7) then take a turn to the left,
  heading east.
- The path will turn you south, where you'll cross a bridge at (F-8).
  This will put you right at (F-9) where the Reinforced Gateway will be
  directly to your right.

Notes

- Galarhigg is fairly easy to defeat with a PLD/NIN and RDM/WHM. The
  only difficulty occurred from Petro Eyes, which left the Paladin
  petrified for several minutes.
- \"Soloed\" easily with Trusts as 75 RDM/BLM.

the Crystal |Reward=* 1,000 Experience Points |Image= }}

Walkthrough

- First, check the Gate of the Gods (next to the Home Point) for a
  cutscene; otherwise, you will not have access to the upper floors
  (3-4).

Retrieving your Light

- You need to climb to the 4th floor of a specific Tower in The Garden
  of Ru'Hmet, which are located in the 5 points of the map.
  - Each Tower corresponds to one of the 5 races.

  - Light of Mea - Elvaan (E).

  - Light of Dem - Mithra (W).

  - Light of Holla - Tarutaru (SW).

  - Light of Vahzl - Humes (N).

  - Light of Al'Taieu - Galka (SE).

- Once you're on the 4th floor of your Tower, check the Ebon Panel
  twice. Once for a cutscene and a new title, then a second time for the
  Key Item of your race.

  - This can be done solo, or with your party, but each person will need
    to get to the top of their corresponding Tower.
  - After you've checked the Ebon Panel twice, to save time you can warp
    out and Home Point back to start the next section below.

Brands of Dawn and Twilight

- Go to the central area of The Garden of Ru'Hmet on the first floor.
  - You cannot reach the elevator directly. Instead, you must run around
    (first East, then North, then West) and access it from the other
    side.
- There are four spinning Qn'zdei on each side of the elevator.
  - The doors will remain open as long as the Qn'zdei are on their
    pedestals.
  - When aggro'd they will move off their pedestal, which causes the
    door at the far end of the room to close.
  - These Qn'zdei are immune to Sleep, Lullaby, and Repose.
  - While not a challenge at iLvl, you will have to wait 5 minutes for
    respawn if you run through and kill them all.
  - The larger crest is the Zdei's \"eye\".
  - The Zdeis only see with the side with the large blue \"eye\", and they
    detect by True Sight only. Therefore, by running along the wall, you
    only have to avoid detection by 2 of them.

If the door closes, simply kill them and auto-run towards the door and
once they respawn you will enter the door.

- Once in the elevator room, step onto the platform and choose to
  ascend.
  - Make sure to grab the Home Point in front of the elevator ramp.
- You must navigate this floor to collect both brands, and (Map 2).
  - When using the Warp Distortions, Trusts will be de-summoned.

  - The Brand of Twilight is to the south and the Brand of Dawn is to
    the north.

  - Brand of Dawn takes less time to get, Brand of Twilight has a longer
    path.
- If you want to save time, warp out and use the Home Point to quickly
  return to the elevator after obtaining each key item.
  - When you have both key items, proceed to the next section below
    here.

Burning Circle Fight

- Head back to the central elevator and choose to ascend until you reach
  the 3rd floor in The Garden of Ru'Hmet.
  - You will need both key items from the previous section to \"ascend\"
    twice, the 2nd time a different elevator animation occurs.
- Check the Particle Gate on the 3rd floor for a cutscene.
- Check it again to enter the BC.
- You begin the BC at the north end of the room, facing south at the
  pots.
  - Soloable at level 80+ with Trust. Possible at level 75+, but very
    difficult. Trivial at Item Level.
  - The exit to this BC is at the south side of the room.
- The BC is against four Ix'zdei NMs.
  - The two larger ones are RDM type.
  - The two smaller ones are BLM type.
  - All of them are immune to silence and are heavily resistant to
    sleep.
  - Elemental Seal is required to sleep the NMs.
  - When a pot gets low on HP, it may attempt to flee to its spawn
    position. If it is allowed to be there a mere few seconds, it will
    regenerate to full HP.
    - Stun and the use of Weapon Skills may prevent this from happening.
  - The safest place to die is at the door at the southern end of the
    room near the BLM pots. Wait for the pots to go back to their
    starting positions before Reraising.
  - Every party member still alive will receive 1,000 Experience Points
    upon winning.
- Walk across the empty room and check the Luminous Convergence for a
  cutscene once you beat the pots.
- After the fight and the following cutscene head south to the 'Particle
  Gate'. Use this door.
  - Choose the option \"Leave the Garden of Ru'Hmet\" then for the next
    option asking if you want to return to the grand palace choose
    \"Yes\".
  - Head south to zone into Al'Taieu for a cutscene to finish this
    Mission and begin the next.

have little to no difficulty with this mission.

- See final cutscenes below to receive your ring after beating
  Promathia.

  - Prishe can be healed if she takes damage.
  - If she's KO'd, you can cast Raise on her and she will resume
    fighting with full HP and no weakness.
  - Prishe will eat an Ambrosia when you start to fight.
  - Prishe uses a Daedalus Wing when you start to fight.
  - Prishe uses the Weapon Skill Auroral Uppercut.
  - Prishe can casts Divine Magic on Promathia and Cure both herself and
    the party.
- Selh'teus joins you for this fight as well.
  - Selh'teus cannot be healed by players, but has several abilities he
    can use to heal himself.
  - Uses the Weapon skill Luminous Lance, which does a bit of damage and
    stuns Promathia.
  - If Selh'teus is KO'd, the battle immediately ends in failure.
- If the entire party is KO'd at any point during the fight, you will be
  immediately removed from the battlefield.
- Promathia has low evasion and is immune to Stun.
- Promathia has two forms. Once you beat the first form, you can rest
  before engaging the second form.
  - After a short period of time, Prishe will engage.

Final Cutscenes

- Wait until Japanese midnight to finish the following epilogue
  cutscenes for Chains of Promathia.
- You can complete these in any order.
- While these cutscenes are not displayed in your Mission log, they all
  have mission names. These names are referenced in the Goblin
  Footprints and Cutscene Replay Bards.
  - Louverance - A Name for the Ages:
    - Head to Southern San d'Oria (Home Point #4) and talk to Hinaree at
      (B-6) for a cutscene.
    - Zone into Uleguerand Range for a cutscene. (Any Home Point you may
      have in the zone, or Voidwatch Warp via Atmacite Refiner ->
      Tavnazia -> Uleguerand Range, works.)
    - Return to Southern San d'Oria and approach Count Caffaule's Manor
      (B-6) for a cutscene.

    - Head to Port Windurst and talk to Chipmy-Popmy at the Fishing
      Guild (C-8) for a cutscene.
      - (Home Point #1).
    - Head to Bibiki Bay - Purgonorgo Isle via the ferry from Bibiki Bay
      and talk to ??? Warmachine (H-11) for a cutscene.
      - The fastest way is to take the Voidwatch Warp from any
        present-day Atmacite Refiner if you've obtained the Hyacinth
        stratum abyssite II. There's an atmacite refiner at Home Point
        #1 in either Tavnazian Safehold or the nearby Windurst Waters.
      - If you have a summer seasonal +1 item with Enchantment: Teleport
        (Purgonorgo Isle), that would take you to the same location.
        Those items are:
        -  / / / / / / /
    - When the cutscene ends, you will receive a colored drop that
      appears to be random.
      - The odds of each are unknown, but it should be one of the
        following: Red (STR+5), Clear (INT+5), Green (AGI+5), Yellow
        (VIT+5) / Purple (DEX+5), Blue (MND+5), White (CHR+5), or Black
        (Instant Warp). Stat buffs last 15 minutes, and all drops will
        give the 1 hour detrimental Medicated effect.
  - Shikarees - In the Name of Justice:
    - Zone into Mhaura for a cutscene.

  - Tenzen - Return to the East:
    - Head to Metalworks and talk to Cid (H-8) for a cutscene.
- Once you've completed the previous cutscenes, head to Ru'Lude Gardens
  and approach the Palace for a cutscene.
- Head to Upper Jeuno and click on the Door: Marble Bridge for a
  cutscene.
- Click on the Marble Bridge door again to choose one of the 3 rings: ,
  , .
  - You can continue with the cutscenes without making your decision
    yet.
- Head to Tavnazian Safehold (Home Point #3) and check the Walnut Door
  (K-7).
- Head to Lufaise Meadows and approach the Blueblade Fell (J-6) for the
  final cutscene.
  - The cutscene trigger is right after the first barrel on the ground
    in the Fell.
- After all cutscenes are over, you have option to start both of the
  quests Requiem of Sin and Storms of Fate.

Optional

- Trust: Ulmia: After defeating Promathia, examine the Dilapidated Gate
  in Misareaux Coast (I-11) to obtain Ulmia as a Trust.

    quicker.

  - Further progress into the CoP epilogue quests (Storms of Fate,
    Shadows of the Departed, Apocalypse Nigh can prevent this cutscene.

- Trust: Prishe: After finishing all the final cutscenes above, examine
  the Walnut Door in Tavnazian Safehold (K-7, Top floor) to obtain
  Prishe as a Trust.
  - Further progress into the CoP epilogue quests (Storms of Fate,
    Shadows of the Departed, Apocalypse Nigh can prevent this cutscene.

- Atma Rewards: You can now purchase the Atma of the Banisher from an
  Atma Fabricant in Abyssea.

- Diabolos cutscene: 'Waking Dreams pt. 9'.
  - If Waking Dreams was already completed, you can see this cutscene
    from the Goblin Footprint in The Shrouded Maw (near Pso'Xja Home
    Point #1), by trading an item or gil to the footprint.
- Tango with a Tracker (level 75+) is available.
  - Requiem of Sin (level 90+) will be available after completing 'Tango
    with a Tracker' and waiting until the next Conquest Tally.

[Map of Jugner Forest (S)]

- Speak to Raustigne in Southern San d'Oria (S) at (I-7/8) for a
  cutscene.
- Examine the Elegant Footprints in Jugner Forest (S) (I-6) for a
  cutscene. It is next to the tree stump near the (H-6)/(I-6) center
  border, just across the makeshift bridge if coming from East Ronfaure
  (S).
  - The fastest way to the Elegant Footprints is the Survival Guide in
    East Ronfaure (S).

- You will be asked to retrieve one of the following items based on
  questions you are asked in the cutscene.
  - The outcome appears to be based on the day the cutscene is started
    and the answers given, but no pattern has been worked out by
    players. Note that disconnecting during the cutscene will not change
    the requested item.
    - If multiple characters begin it on the same day and use the same
      answers, they will get the same requested item.
    - See Item Request Testimonies on the talk page for choices and
      days.
  - Gold Beastcoin
  - Lynx Meat
  - Nyumomo Doll - Farmed in Batallia Downs (not Batallia Downs (S))
    from Orcish Beastrider, Orcish Brawler, Orcish Impaler, Orcish
    Nightraider with droprate. Treasure Hunter is highly recommended.
- Zone (logging out doesn't count), then trade the item to the Elegant
  Footprints for another cutscene to complete the mission.

Notes

- To save time on the next mission, kill Wandering Saplings for a
  Cernunnos Bulb before leaving Jugner Forest (S). Each member
  completing the missions will need a bulb. Some Wandering Saplings can
  be found at (J-6) and (F-10).

[Map of Jugner Forest (S)]

- Speak to Amaura in Southern San d'Oria HP #4 at (G-6). She will
  request a Cernunnos Bulb.
  - (Optional) Speaking to Amaura again will have her restate some
    recycled dialogue about Cernunnos resin.
  - The fastest route to her would be to take Home Point #4 for Southern
    San d'Oria.
  - If you did not farm one after Dancers in Distress as recommended,
    kill Wandering Saplings in Jugner Forest (S) for a Cernunnos Bulb.
- Trade the Cernunnos Bulb to Amaura and watch the cutscene.
- Trade the Cernunnos Bulb to the Humus-rich Earth in Jugner Forest (S)
  at (E-6) to plant it.
  - The fastest way to get here is using the Campaign Arbiter warp and
    riding a mount Northwest.
  - Be careful of aggro from the Lobisons in the area.
- Now time travel to Jugner Forest (Present Day) and examine the
  Humus-rich Earth at the same spot for a cutscene.
  - The Outpost warp for Norvallen will take you fairly close and the
    Voidwatch warp is a little farther.
- Examine the Humus-rich Earth again to spawn the mob Cernunnos.
  - Cernunnos is a Treant-type mob that can cast spells such as Protect
    IV, Shell IV, Stone IV, Stonega III.
- Examine the Humus-rich Earth again after defeating Cernunnos to obtain
  the Cernunnos resin.
- Return to Amaura with the key item for a cutscene.
- Speak to Amaura after waiting until the next game day and zoning to
  obtain the Bottle of treant tonic and complete the mission.
  - (Optional) She'll suggest you do some household chores for her if
    you speak with her before then. If you speak to her after the day
    has changed but without zoning, she'll tell you she's busy brewing a
    powerful potion.
  - You may be required to talk to her multiple times if you are
    currently doing the To Cure a Cough quest. Cough medicine is not the
    required key item.

Windower, it is recommended to disable any addons or options that adjust
framerate such as FastCS or running at 60FPS. It has been known to cause
this cutscene to freeze. If running at 60 FPS, you may also type
//config FrameRateDivisor 2 at the moment the cutscene freezes to allow
it to continue before using //config FrameRateDivisor 1 to return it to
60 FPS. (Hitting PrintScreen key when the scene is freezing, can also
help it continue)

Walkthrough

- In Sauromugue Champaign (S), examine the Bulwark Gate at (E-6)/(F-6)
  for a cutscene to receive the Underpass hatch key and to complete the
  mission.
  - The Campaign Arbiter warp from your allied nation will teleport you
    to a fairly close location. Mount up and ride north and west to
    reach the location.
  - Taking the Survival Guide warp to Rolanberry Fields in the present
    time and entering the Voidwatch passage to the past (which is right
    next to survival guide) will also bring you very close to the gate
    needed.
  - You are given a dialogue choice during the cutscene. The second
    option gives a small optional bit of text but you must choose the
    first to progress.
  - Depending on your progress in the Voidwatch quest line, you may get
    a brief cutscene with the Jeunoan leader. Examine the Bulwark Gate
    again to continue with the Wings of the Goddess mission.

  { title = "A Nation on the Brink", walkthrough = [[Walkthrough

- Examine the Underpass Hatch in Batallia Downs (S) at (J-9)/(K-9) for a
  cutscene. The Hatch is on the rampart inside of a tower.
  - If you have progressed a bit in Voidwatch, you can use the Atmacite
    Refiner in Sauromugue Champaign (S) from the last mission's cutscene
    to get here swiftly. Otherwise, the Campaign Arbiter warp from your
    allied nation will get you somewhat close.

A Nation on the Brink

[The Everbloom Hollow map this fight is on]

- Click the Underpass Hatch again to enter Everbloom Hollow for the A
  Nation on the Brink instance battlefield.
- Up to six players may enter at once as long as they have a Underpass
  hatch key or have completed the quest previously. The party leader
  must have the Underpass hatch key to take the party in.
- The objective is to defeat One-eyed Gwajboj, who will spawn once the
  waves of beastmen are defeated. He is a Paladin that may use
  Invincible multiple times.
- Trusts can be summoned.
- All of the mobs inside the instance are immune to all forms of Sleep.
  Bind and Gravity immunity unknown, but is generally the case for many
  WotG NMs.

  Mihgo, Iron Ram Knights x2, 7th Cohors Legionnaires x2, Cobra
  Mercenaries x2.

    will run to find two waves of mobs:
    - Zazarg and the 7th Cohors Legionnaires will fight a wave
      consisting of a Ruby Quadav and 4 Nickel Quadavs in the Northwest.
      Once they are defeated, they will run in further to find a second
      wave consisting of 2 Ruby Quadavs and 3 Nickel Quadavs.
    - Rongelouts N Distaud and the Iron Ram Knights will fight a wave
      consisting of an Orcish Hexspinner and 4 Orcish Gladiators in the
      Northeast. Once they are defeated, they will run forward to find a
      second wave consisting of 2 Orcish Hexspinners and 3 Orcish
      Gladiators.
    - Romaa Mihgo and the Cobra Mercenaries will fight a wave consisting
      of a Yagudo Abbot and 4 Yagudo Missionaries in the South. Once
      defeated, they will run forward to find a second wave consisting
      of 2 Yagudo Abbots and 3 Yagudo Missionaries.

Walkthrough

- You need to retrieve three key items used to pop Goblin Notorious
  Monsters. Any characters on (or past) this mission can receive the
  goblin food key items as long as they are in the same party/alliance.
  - These key items have a 10% obtainment rate. If you are in a
    party/alliance, 1 character at random will be chosen to receive it
    (if they don't have it already).

NOTE: You must have the respective goblin food key item when the NM is
killed in order to obtain the seedspall key item.

      flower to the glowing spot at Batallia Downs (F-5) to teleport up.
    - You can teleport to Beaucedine Glacier via Voidwatch NPC (requires
      level 75 and Adventurer's Certificate) or survival guide. Walking
      there requires going through Ranguemont Pass (requires
      Adventurer's Certificate).

  Goblin juice. Examine the ??? at (D-11) to pop Chuglix Berrypaws, and

Walkthrough

- During this mission, you will have to examine Seed Fragments in each
  zone to receive a level cap status (level 30). While under the effects
  of this level cap, you will be able to collect key items by touching
  Seed Afterglows. You will not be able to be cured by people who are
  not under the level cap status, but you will also not lose Experience
  Points should you die.
  - Trust Magic is not available during this level restriction effect.
- Prism Powders and Silent Oils are recommended if you solo this, as
  there can be monsters that aggro by magic around such as dolls and
  elementals. Seed Fragments tend to be surrounded by monsters that
  aggro by sight in most cases, so you'll want to drop your invisibility
  next to the Seed Fragment as soon as they are all facing away from
  you, examine it, and become invisible again as quickly as possible.

[] You must find and plant a Shadow bug on 5 Cait Siths scattered
throughout Beaucedine Glacier (S).
At each tower you will be required to complete a mini game to attach the
Shadow bug to a Cait Sith by clicking the Regal Pawprints.
Note: Order does not matter, in this walkthrough they are listed
bottom-to-top. If you use the Survival Guide, reverse the order. Be
mindful that there are several other Regal Pawprints in the area used
for following missions.
You have three tries to complete each mini game. If you fail, simply try
again. You do not need to zone.
*Cait Sith Coig is at the tower at (J-8). You must hit it with a blow
dart to attach the bug.

- - Moves back and forth in a seemingly random pattern.

Note: Easiest way to win the 3 following 'Red Light, Green Light'
minigames is to wait till Cait Sith's head is turned 45-degrees to move.
The Cait Sith will turn at entirely random intervals. When she turns at
a 45-degree angle however, the next turn will always be facing away.
This is the very best time to move. You can move 2-4 (even 5 if you're
risky) times when she finally does a 45-degree turn.
If you are using the FastCS addon, unload it before initiating this
minigame, as it will make it substantially more difficult.

- Cait Sith Seachd is at the tower at (I-7). You must direct Lilisette
  in a game of 'Red Light, Green' Light until she is close enough to
  plant the bug.
  - If you see Lilisette put her hands on her hips it means she will
    move 2 steps instead of one the next time you tell her to move.
- Cait Sith Ceithir is at the tower at (G-9). You must direct Portia in
  a game of 'Red Light, Green Light' until she is close enough to plant
  the bug.
  - If Portia begins to panic she will be much slower the next time you
    tell her to move.
- Cait Sith Aon is at the tower at (H-8). You play a game of 'Red Light,

  - This is the tower the Campaign Arbiter will teleport you to.
- Cait Sith Tri is at the tower at (F-7). Here you are transformed into
  a baby chocobo and have to sneak up on Cait Sith Tri.
  - You only have 1 minute until your disguise wears off.
  - You have the option of either chirping or wiggling your butt to get
    the Cait Sith's attention.
  - Once the Cait Sith is close enough, a third menu option \"Stun!\" will
    appear. Use the stun option to complete this mini game.

Once you have planted a bug on all 5 Cait Sith's, check the Regal
Pawprints at (H-10). These pawprints are not at the base of the tower
like the others. They are under a large broken tree branch near the
tower.

- Examine the Regal Pawprints (H-9) Beaucedine Glacier (S) for a
  cutscene. The target is behind the tree near the bottom of the ramp
  from the Campaign Arbiter.

  Count Halphas and 4 Dark Demons.
  - Only Count Halphas needs to be defeated to continue. Once he is dead
    the Dark Demons will vanish.
  - The Dark Demons can be slept with sleepga, however Count Halphas is
    immune to sleep.

- Examine the Regal Pawprints Beaucedine Glacier (S) (G-9, east side,
  high ground. Do NOT go to the tower.) for a cutscene. (It's labelled
  in White on the map on this page.)
  - This is south-west and on the same level as the Campaign warp
    (Moana, C.A.) and the tower; do not head down the ramp.
- Examine the Regal Pawprints again to enter the battlefield at
  Everbloom Hollow.
- You have 30 minutes to complete the mission.
  - If you fail you can get another Aroma bug at Naoi's Regal Pawprints
    at (H-10).
  - There's no timer to indicate how much time you have left, but you'll
    get warnings in the log at the 10, 5, and 1 minute marks.

There is very little fighting to do in this battlefield. Instead your
goal is to reach the exit of this maze before time runs out.

- Everyone in your party will receive two Ratstail Explosives. These
  Ratstail Explosives are used at the ???'s to blow up the walls at dead
  ends, allowing you to progress further.
  - Each party member can only carry a maximum of 3 Ratstail Explosives
    at one time.
  - If you need more Ratstail Explosive, you can kill Goblin Reavers.
    Once dead, the goblin will leave a ??? behind that will have more
    explosives for you.
- Everyone in your party will also be given jars of Firesand.
  - These can be buried at specific color coded detonators near walls
    that can be blown up.
  - There are also several color coded switches scattered across the
    level. If you use a switch after you have buried Firesand at it's
    matching detonator, it will blow up another wall.
- There is a Giddy Bomb enemy unique to this mission in addition to the
  Goblin Reaver, but it is also extremely weak and seemingly uneventful.

The mission will end when someone in your party finds the exit.

Battlefield Navigation

[] []

- Go northwest to start and hug the right wall. Blow up the wall at
  (H/I-9), go through the hole you just created then blow up the wall to
  the north at (H-8). Double back and kill the Goblin Reaver to obtain
  the 3 explosives. (Do not forget this! Check the ??? left in its place
  once per explosive.)
- Blow up the wall to the southeast at (I-9), then proceed through it
  northeast until you reach the dead-end at (J-7). Examine the ??? for a
  cutscene. It tells you about Firesand, and also gives you a virtual
  temp item Firesand (which doesn't actually appear in your temporary
  items proper).
  - Examine the dead-end again, and place the jar of Firesand.
- Circle back to the wall you opened at (H-8) and continue through the
  opening. Go to (H-7/I-7) and trigger the glowing green switch.
- Go back to the dead-end at (J-7) where you left the Firesand and run
  through where the wall was to enter Map 2. Ensure you have at least 2
  Ratstail Explosives before proceeding, as no Goblin Reavers spawn
  there.
- Blow up the wall to the southeast at (G-8/9).
- Travel east and blow up the wall at (I-9).
- Continue southeast and examine the blue warp ??? to exit.

past a set of Regal Pawprints. Examine them to be warped directly to
Ruhotz Silvermines for the battle (no cutscene).

- You have 30 minutes to complete this battle.
- If you fail this mission, you can get another Umbra bug from the Regal
  Pawprint under the tree root at (H-10), one of the locations you
  previously spoke to Cait Sith Naoi. To get back to the battle from
  this location, you'll want to ascend two ramps in the zone, then head
  northwest to the knob of rock in the ground you were at before in
  (H-7), near which is the Regal Pawprint. You are limited to 1 Key Item
  per game day.

Fight

This fight is against Cait Sith Ceithir. Cait Sith Ceithir is a Black
Mage and can cast most Black Magic spells.

- Uses the following TP moves:
  - Regal Scratch: single-target damage.
  - Divine Favor: Full Erase.
  - Mewing Lullaby: AoE sleep and resets all TP to 0.
  - Eerie Eye: Amnesia + Silence.
  - Level ? Holy: Cait Sith Ceithir will roll dice right before he uses
    this move. The dice roll determines the damage this move deals. It
    can be anywhere from 150 - 1500+ AoE damage. There is also a chance
    the move will have no effect.
- Will summon Atomos from time to time to help him in battle.
  - When summoned, Atomos will do two moves in a row and then vanish.
  - Soul Vacuum: drains attributes from all players in range. All stats
    are reduced by about 50 points.
  - Soul Infusion: used right after Soul Vacuum, this move transfers all
    the stats drained from your party to Cait Sith Ceithir.
  - There does not appear to be any way to stop Atomos once he appears.

You will be assisted by Lilisette during this fight. Lilisette can be
buffed/healed by anyone in your party.

- Has access to the following moves:
  - Sensual Dance: AoE Attack Bonus
  - Thorned Stance: Defense Bonus
  - Whirling Edge: single-target WS.
  - Lilisette can be used to tank the entire fight if you wish. Simply
    bring several healers to keep her alive while she does all the work.
- If Lilisette dies the mission ends in failure.
- If you're a solo player using Trusts and having issues with Level ?
  Holy one-shotting you, try engaging the enemy, debuffing/damaging it
  as much as you feel comfortable, and then running a good distance away
  before Holy could possibly be cast. Your Trusts will continue to fight
  the enemy, but there are multiple reports that Cait Sith may not
  actually use Level ? Holy at all, and Atomos might not even use Soul
  Vacuum, while the player is out of range.
  - However at ilevel 119 you really should have no trouble with this,
    and only ever have to deal with a single Level ? Holy.

Walkthrough

To streamline this walkthrough, collect all three key items in advance
and complete all three cutscenes in one trip to save time.

- Go to Gusgen Mines or Palborough Mines or Ifrit's Cauldron and mine
  for the sturdy metal strip, return to Upper Jeuno and examine the
  Inconspicuous Door for a cutscene.
- Go to Jugner Forest or Ghelsba Outpost and log for the piece of rugged
  tree bark, return to Upper Jeuno and examine the Inconspicuous Door
  for a cutscene.
- Go to Giddeus or West Sarutabaruta and harvest the savory lamb roast,
  return to Upper Jeuno and examine the Inconspicuous Door (H-8) (across
  from Durable Shields) for a cutscene.

    

- These key items can be obtained in any order, even before the moogle
  even asks for them.
- Ensure your inventory is full before attempting to gather at a node,
  allowing repeated attempts to obtain the Key Item, as the node
  persists even if the gathered item can't be received, saving you the
  hassle of chasing new nodes when your sole goal is completing the
  quest.
- It can take anywhere from 3-5 attempts to even 50+ attempts. Breaks
  are uncommon but can happen. Bring at least 1 stack of each tool to
  avoid having to run back to town.

\"A Moogle Kupo d'Etat\" Key

- Re-obtain another sturdy metal strip, piece of rugged tree bark, and
  savory lamb roast.
- Head to Port Jeuno and ask Squintrox Dryeyes (G-8) for a Blue coral
  key to make the exchange.
  - The key can be received once per day.

  zone.
- Head to the zone mentioned by your moogle and attempt to dig up its
  treasure, a Moldy, worm-eaten chest.
  - You will need Gysahl Greens to make your chocobo dig.
  - This may take multiple tries, so be sure to plan with a proper
    amount of Gysahl Greens. (A stack, more in some cases.)
  - Each time you dig you are given a general direction the treasure is
    as well as a hint about how close it is to your current location.
    - When you get the message \"You are convinced that your moogle
      friend has been digging in the immediate vicinity.\", it means you
      are almost right on top of the treasure.
- Return to the Inconspicuous Door in Upper Jeuno (H-8) (across from

Walkthrough

- Make sure you possess the Map of the Quicksand Caves before you start!
  This is required.
- Head to Western Altepa Desert (D-12) or use Geomagnetic Fount Waypoint
  to get to Quicksand Caves map 5.
  - Alternatively use Quicksand Caves Home Point #1 for the Chamber of
    Oracles and exit out from exit 5 of map 5 at (H-4) to Western Altepa
    Desert. Once out go south towards the hidden area of (D-12) that
    will bring you straight to the goblin at entrance 4.

[] []

- Speak to the Goblin Geologist at (J-11), he will ask you to gather 9
  Key Items from ??? spots scattered around the Quicksand Caves.
  - Stone of Surya

  - Stone of Chandra

  - Stone of Mangala

  - Stone of Budha

  - Stone of Brihaspati

  - Stone of Shukra

  - Stone of Shani

  - Stone of Rahu

  - Stone of Ketu
- The Goblin will mark the locations on your map, so if you do not
  possess a Map of the Quicksand Caves you will be unable to proceed
  with the mission. The markers will appear in the green Markers
  section.
  - Due to the markers being saved locally and being random from a
    select pool of options it is advisable to finish the mission on the
    same PC you started this step in, in one go, or to make a
    backup/upload of the data.
  - The markers do not clear after being collected so make sure to
    remember the ones you already got or you'll have to check them all
    again.
  - You can use the \"Change Map\" option to check the green Markers in
    other maps and plan which entrances you may need to use.
- The following entrances can contain the needed ???:

Western Altepa Desert:

- (G-5) Entrance 6 to Quicksand Caves Map 5
- (J-9) Entrance 2 to Quicksand Caves Map 3,x Map 4
  - Map 4 can be reached by going to (D-11) on Map 3, exit C.

[] []
[]
Eastern Altepa Desert:

- (K-7) Entrance 1 to Quicksand Caves Map 1
- (H-10) Entrance 4 to Quicksand Caves Map 2

[] []
[]

- These can require multiple one-way drops to reach, you should consider
  having an easy way to return to Eastern Altepa Desert such as
  Teleport-Altep and Instant Warp to get out of the maps/fix mistakes as
  needed, unless you want to walk through the maps.
  - The Quicksand Caves Home Point #2 can be useful for some of these,
    as it brings you on Map 1 just outside of the Cloister of Tremors,
    also conveniently near Exit 3. Consider grabbing it on the way if
    you don't have it.
- Once you return to the Goblin Geologist with all nine stones, you will
  receive a Navaratna talisman.
- Enter the Chamber of Oracles and examine the Shimmering Circle for the
  cutscene that completes this mission.
  - Home Point #1 just outside the Chamber of Oracles. It's a great time
    to unlock it if you don't have it already.
  - If you have completed the Open Sesame quest for the Loadstone or
    you're a Galka, you can use the pressure pads to make your way to
    the Chamber of Oracles solo. Otherwise, you would need to stand on
    the pressure pads with other players (Trusts do not count): 3
    Tarutaru or any combination of 2 of Hume/Elvaan/Mithra.
  - Path from Goblin Geologist to Chamber of Oracles:
    - Go to (I-9) and step on the weight pad and go through the door.
    - Go west to (H-7) and use another weight pad to pass through a
      door.
    - In the next room, drop down the hole to a hidden area.
    - Head to (D-4) to zone in to the Chamber of Oracles.

Notes

- None of the ??? require using the weight switches to open any door,
  but it is recommended you do the Open Sesame quest for the Loadstone
  if you haven't attuned to Quicksand Caves Home Point #1 and #2 as it a
  convenient time to do this.

Walkthrough

- In the Chamber of Oracles, examine the Shimmering Circle to enter the
  battlefield with the same name as the mission.
  - Home Point #1 is the fastest way.
- In the battlefield, you will fight the following mobs:
  - Nanaa Mihgo
    - Nanaa Mihgo's normal melee attacks have the chance to give
      additional effect Paralyze, Stun, or Poison.
    - Nanna Mihgo has access to normal Dagger weapon skills, such as
      Viper Bite, Wasp Sting, Dancing Edge, and Evisceration. She also
      has access to a special weapon skill called: King Cobra Clamp that
      does conal damage and has an additional effect of Paralyze, Stun,
      and Poison.
    - Twice during the fight Nanna Mihgo will summon either Bopa Greso
      or Cha Lebagta.
  - Goblin Repossessor (THF)
  - Goblin Intimidator (WAR)
  - Goblin Enforcer (RDM)
- All of the mobs in the battlefield are susceptible to Sleep and
  Repose. As Nanaa Mihgo is much stronger than the Goblins, it would be
  a wise strategy to sleep her while taking out the lesser threats.
  - You only need to defeat Nanaa Mihgo to complete the battlefield
  - Trust Magic can be used in this battlefield.
- Once completed you will receive a Red coral key and a cutscene and the
  next mission will begin.

- You can repeat the battlefield for another Red coral key by
  re-obtaining a Navaratna talisman from the previous mission.
  - Alternatively, a Navaratna talisman can be purchased from Squintrox
    Dryeyes for 1500g and 15 Beastmen's Seals after all A Moogle Kupo

Walkthrough

[]

- Examine the Shadowy Pillar at Castle Zvahl Baileys (J-8), you will
  then be directed to Beaucedine Glacier.
  - The fastest way is to teleport with the Survival Guide.
- Examine the Lonely Evergreen at the center of Beaucedine Glacier (G-7)
  for a cutscene.
- Go to the Tower at (H-8) to speak to Goblin Grenadier.
  - You need a Map of the Northlands area to advance through this part
    of the mission.
- You will need to enter a combination to a chest.
  - Hints are given by touching the 6 Pips in the area to spawn
    elemental NPCs.
    - Make sure as the goblin says to not leave the zone or this will
      reset! The markers can be found in the green markers option of the
      map
  - The elementals form a pattern following the days of the Vana'diel
    week, so pay attention to the days which are directly next to each
    other.
    - Firesday > Earthsday > Watersday > Windsday > Iceday >
      Lightningday > Lightsday > Darksday
  - If you \"connect the dots\" following the pattern of the days of the
    week, it should form the number that you need. Imagine you are
    writing a number like an old alarm or clock.
    - Days can loop around, so you can connect Fire - Dark.
    - \"Connecting the dots\" only applies straight-across, and up or
      down. Connections cannot be made diagonally.
    - The order of the pips themselves does not matter
      (north/south/clockwise/counter-clockwise/left/right/top/bottom/etc.).
    - Recommend grabbing a piece of paper, drawing 6 dots, and drawing
      connecting lines between each pair of pips that are next to
      each-other in the Vana'diel week. Do this pair by pair. (Can draw
      x's between each pair that are not next to each-other.) Then look
      at the number you have drawn.
    - For example if the dots are in the order of Water > Earth > Dark >
      Fire > Light > Lightning from top left to right, top to bottom,
      the number would be 2.

[]

- Speak to the Goblin Grenadier to guess the password, a number between
  0-9. You may accept up to 2 additional hints before guessing.
- You will get a pocket mogbomb for opening the chest, as well as a Flee
  status effect (+60% movement speed) that lasts for 5 minutes if you
  did not use any hints.
- Return to the Lonely Evergreen at (G-7) to receive the Trivia
  Challenge Kupon.
- In Xarcabard you will find three Option spots. Option One is at
  (G/H-8), Option Two is at (G-9), and Option Three is at (G-8).
- You must answer three questions correctly in order to win. It does not
  matter which Option spot you select first.
  - You will be asked 3 among the following trivia questions:
    - HP+MP
    - Job level sum
    - Crafting skill sum
    - Elemental resistance sum
    - Total kills
    - Attack x Defense
    - Mog house entrances
    - Total deaths
    - Joined party
    - Joined alliance
- You are given 2 options, each a number. Do the following:
  *Divide bigger number by smaller number.
  - - If value is ~2, then the answer is the bigger number option
    - If the value is ~1.5, then the answer is the smaller number
      option.
  - One of the options may even be a 0 (crafting, for example); in this
    case it will be the 0 option.
- Upon winning, you will receive Gauntlet Challenge Kupon.
- Zone into Castle Zvahl Baileys and speak to the Shadowy Pillar by the
  zoneline.
  - Your level will then be lowered to 1, and you will be granted Sneak,
    Invisible (Status) and Deodorize effects.
    - The effect durations are random. They can be 3-7 minutes long.
      - Prism Powder and Silent Oil is recommended in case you're
        unlucky with the amount of time you have the effect.
  - You must reach the Flames of Fate before 8 minutes have passed since
    your level cap.
  - The Flames of Fate are located right before the Castle Zvahl Keep
    zoneline. Completing this nets you a Festival Souvenir Kupon.
    - Follow these directions if you are not familiar: from the Shadowy
      Pillar, follow the path into the Baileys until the first
      intersection. Take a right, then at the end of that path, turn and
      go down the stairs, take a quick left then right, then continue to
      stay to the right towards the map change at A on Map 1. This leads
      to Map 2.
    - On Map 2, follow the path straight north (ignoring the option to
      turn left/west early on) and go up the stairs on the left when you
      see them. Do not go down any holes on the upper level, nor the the
      other set of stairs nearby. Instead, head southwest around the
      first hole and across the bridge leading west, to another section
      with a hole, where you will be able to turn right/north to go down
      completely different stairs. Take a right, staying on the lower
      floor, then another right crossing under the bridge you just
      passed. Take the first right past the bridge, then a left and
      another left that will lead you to some stairs back up to the
      upper level. Turn right and continue forward toward the exit to
      Castle Zvahl Keep. The flame is still within the Baileys, on the
      floor below the last torch on the left at (G-8) (you may wish to
      press toward the left when targeting). As you are presumably still
      Invisible, you will naturally need to drop Invis to click the
      flame.
    - Make sure not to go past the flame/torches and up the huge stairs
      that zone into the next area, or you'll have to do a walk of shame
      back to the pillar!

[] []

- Upon zoning into Castle Zvahl Keep following the previous challenge,
  speak to the Ominous Pillar by the zone line (before you enter the
  large room ahead).
  - You will be asked to find a slacking moogle. This can be done by
    examining Craggy Pillars located along the way to the Throne Room.
    Make sure you inspect a pillar after each teleport. Completing this
    nets you a Mega Bonanza Kupon.

[]

- Craggy Pillars are pillars located somewhere in each room directly
  after taking one of the beastmen beacon teleporters. Remember, to get
  to the teleporter room, take either exit A or B (passing through Iron
  Gates and Ore Doors), then take exit C into Map 3. You'll be taking
  the teleporters up to 4 times, depending on which room your target is
  in.
  - The 4th warp is the exception; the Craggy Pillar is in the next room
    to the south.
  - Make sure not to accidentally zone into the next area, or you'll
    have to do a walk of shame back to the Ominous Pillar!
- After obtaining the Mega Bonanza Kupon, continue teleporting if need
  be to approach, then walk through, the Throne Room.
- Examine the Throne Room door for a cutscene.
  - Watching the cutscene completes the mission.

Walkthrough

- Examine the Throne Room door to enter the BC.
- Once you enter the BC, you begin the fight against Riko Kupenreich.
  - His basic attacks are special moves where he throws out bombs
    dealing conal AoE damage with knockback. Barfira seems to reduce the
    damage taken. Slow debuffs and Spikes will have no effect.
  - Riko Kupenreich uses the following weapon skills.
    - Washtub: AoE 200~400DMG, absorbed by 3 Shadows.
    - Bill Toss: Terror
    - Crystalline Flare: Draw-in and AoE 300~600 DMG with additional
      effect of Blind and Stun (~15 seconds).
  - He has the ability to teleport within the arena.
- Upon taking 50% of his max HP in damage, Riko Kupenreich will summon 5
  Henchmen Moogle Black Mages at his location and 2 Henchmen Moogle
  White Mages on top of the throne dias where he will retreat.
  - The Black Mages are susceptible to sleep or lullaby, and can be
    killed. They cast Tier III -ga and Tier IV spells.
  - The White Mages cannot be damaged or slept and will repeatedly cast
    Cure V on Riko Kupenreich.
  - Moogle Henchmen have the following weaponskills:
    - Mog Shrapnel: Conal \"Gil Toss\" TP move, Does about 20~200DMG,
      Really Weak
    - Mog Bomb: 200~400 DMG, Pretty Weak. Fire based of course.
    - Flowerpot: single-target Amnesia, Bind, and Stun.
  - After Riko Kupenreich is fully healed or the Black Mages are dead
    and despawned, he will return to the battle.
  - He will do the Black Mage / White Mage adds phase a 2nd time after
    losing another 50% health.
  - During the 3rd and final adds phase, Riko Kupenreich will spawn the
    Black Mages and does not retreat.
    - This is the most dangerous part of the fight, as you'll be dealing
      with Crystalline Flare and the Black Mages at the same time.
  - Riko Kupenreich fully resists Sleep spells. Is susceptible to Stun.
- Riko Kupenreich and his henchmen take increased damage from all
  sources, but also have very high HP.

- Once you win you will receive an Angel skin key and an Oxblood key.
  - It possible to skip phase 2 by killing Riko extremely fast at 119
    gear levels. (You can summon Trusts in this fight, if doing it
    before item level 119.)
  - Should you fail during this fight, you will have to restart the
    process at Kupo Mission 13. (Note: you may start repeating the
    mission by returning to the Lonely Evergreen in Beaucedine Glacier.
    You do not need to start from checking the initial pillar back in
    Castle Zvahl Baileys.)

\"A Moogle Kupo d'Etat\" Key

- Re-obtain an Mega Bonanza Kupon from the previous mission.
  - Alternatively, Mega Bonanza Kupon can be purchased from Squintrox

Walkthrough

- Head to Tenshodo in Lower Jeuno and examine the Treasure Chest for
  your reward.
  - The easiest way to repeat the fight to change your augmented item is
    to first toss it, then purchase the Mega Bonanza Kupon from
    Squintrox Dryeyes in Port Jeuno for 2,000 gil and 20 Beastmen Seals.
    - This will allow you to quickly re-enter the BCNM in the Throne
      Room. Even with a Mega Bonanza Kupon, you will not be able to
      re-enter the BCNM if you still have the Angel skin key. You must
      first exchange it with the red chest in the Lower Jeuno Tenshodo.
  - There is a Japanese Midnight wait on immediately repeating the
    fight. Otherwise you will receive the message: \"Mega Bonanza Kupon
    has no effect. You cannot enter battlefield at present. Please wait
    a little longer\".
- After the fight, you will immediately receive your key rewards.

  Enfeeblement Kit of Sleep, Enfeeblement Kit of Poison, or Enfeeblement
  Kit of Blindness.
  - If you do not recall which item you have been tasked with creating,
    speak with one of the NPCs listed below. They will give you the
    recipes for making the components, but you do not have to talk to
    them at any point in the gathering of ingredients or the synthing of
    items.
    - Kuroido-Moido at (E-7) in Port Windurst.
    - Faulpie at (E-8) in Southern San d'Oria.

  an Earth Crystal.
  - As a note, all of the components can be traded, but the enfeeblement
    kit itself cannot, and therefore must be synthed by the player doing
    the mission.

    ingredients.
  - An Alchemy level of 10 is recommended to synth the Enfeeblement Kit
    to increase the chances of success.

  - You can buy another 12 Blank Soul Plates from him each day (after JP
    Midnight).
  - Note: he will only accept Soul Plates of monsters found in Sea
    Serpent Grotto.
- How to take pictures:
  - Equip the Soultrapper into your Ranged slot, and the Blank Soul
    Plates into your Ammo slot.
  - You can then use the Soultrapper via the Inventory onto a target, or
    alternatively, use a macro line /item \"Soultrapper\" or any
    equivalent.
  - The Soultrapper cannot be used while under the effect of Sneak or
    Invisible.
  - Sometimes you'll fail taking a picture. Just try again!
- Andrause will mention which monsters he's \"investigating\", and
  depending on the monsters chosen, you may need a , or to gain access
  to them:
  - Monsters found in the open area: Bigclaw (M-14), Brook Sahagin,

    movement speed bonuses.
  - Survival Guide in Gustav Tunnel (K-7) puts you on the opposite end
    of the tunnel. You will not need Sneak at level 75.
- The following fight is trivial at level cap, but if you're at a lower
  level, prepare to battle:
- Interacting with the Outcropping again will start a fight against 3
  Tenshodo agents named Renfred, Bompupu and Gorattz and consume the
  Black book Key Item.
  - Trust Magic can not be used in this fight.
  - You will keep your buffs: Phalanx will negate all damage from this
    fight except Bompupu's nukes.
- The 3 agents start off untargetable and cast Utsusemi: Ni a few times,
  then 4 clones of each will spawn.
  - The clones aren't very strong, having low HP, accuracy, attack and
    defense, and cast elemental and enfeebling Ninjutsu.
- At some point (either time elapsed or number of clones defeated), the
  3 agents will join the fight, at which time they can be attacked, and
  must be defeated in order to win the encounter.
  - They can be differentiated from the clones because they have higher
    HP and will continue to cast Utsusemi as well as other Ninjutsu.
  - Once in the fight, they will still continue to spawn clones as the
    clones are dispatched.
  - Once an agent is defeated, any of his or her remaining clones will
    despawn after a couple of seconds.
- When all 3 agents are down, you will be rewarded a Cactuar key, which
  can be redeemed at the Treasure Coffer in Tenshodo Headquarters in
  Lower Jeuno.

waves of weak mobs.
Upon defeating a wave, the last mob from that wave will flee to a nearby
wall and detonate, allowing you to proceed to the next room. []

- A good strategy is to have a tank gather up the mobs and have a Black
  Mage or two to use -ga spells to eliminate the weak mobs.
- In the last room 3 Arch Demons will pop among the weaker beastmen. The
  demons will have higher HP, and will not be disposed of easily with
  AoE spells, a good melee or two can defeat the demons.
- After defeating all enemies in all three rooms, talk to Pesoso again
  to exit.
  - You will receive the express message \"Operation successful! The
    caverns have been cleared of all hostiles. You should report back to
    Pesoso immediately.\" when all enemies have been defeated. If you do
    not receive this message after seemingly clearing the third room,

    you, as enemies from the third room gradually approach the first

report back to captain Antje to complete the mission.

  - Failing to refresh the stimulant will require you to return to Antje
    and start from square one.
  - Note: It only fails you if you talk to the NPC without Flee Status.
    You can cheese this using the Flee JA, Powder Boots (can have
    multiple pairs), and even using latent effect gear that can give you
    Flee when you're hit before talking to the next NPC. It will
    continue your timer once again as nothing wrong has happened.
  - Note!!: It will not be refreshed from the NPCs if you used Flee(JA)
    or an item such as Powder Boots or item effect after speaking to
    them. Bringing multiple items (5+) is recommended if you lose
    original flee effect from operatives and then start relying on
    items.
- Upon speaking to an operative, they will detonate their charge and a
  flash of smoke will also appear in the distance, hinting the next
  operative's position. Keep an eye out for where this is to keep your
  bearings.
- When you first start, the blast will be south of the NPC (Antje), and
  the circuit below will continue in a counter-clockwise direction.

    all weaponskills for that weapon, also has an ability at low HP
    called Essence Jack that will lower your statuses, inflict terror,

You will have to collect 8 dawndrops. The following can be done in any
order:

- Ronfaure dawndrop: automatically obtained at the start of this
  Mission.

- Jugner dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in Jugner Forest (S) at
  (I-6).

  - Survival Guide to East Ronfaure (S), then head east across the
    bridge in Jugner Forest (S), is the fastest way. It's nearby the
    Elegant Footprints from an earlier mission on the eastern side of
    the river.

- La Vaule dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in La Vaule (S) at (K-9),
  lower right of the grid next to a house.

  - You can access La Vaule (S) from (G-11) in Jugner Forest (S); there
    is a Survival Guide in Jugner Forest (S) right near the entrance.

- San d'Oria dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in Southern San
  d'Oria (S) at (K-6).

  - Near the Lion Springs Tavern.

- Beaucedine dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in Beaucedine
  Glacier (S) at (H-9).

  - Down the ramp from the Regal Pawprints near the Campaign warp at
    (H-8).

- Xarcabard dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in Xarcabard (S) HP #1 at
  (F-8).

  - Next to Rally Point: Red.

- Throne Room dawndrop: examine the Blank Target in Throne Room (S)
  (Castle Zvahl Keep [S], HP #1)

  - Middle of walkway, west side.

- Walk of Echoes dawndrop: It is best to do this one last, as the next
  mission is at Walk of Echoes. Examine the Blank Target in Walk of
  Echoes south of the conflux.

  - The C.A (Campaign Arbiter) Warp Grauberg (S) will bring you closest
    to reach the Witchfire Glen Veridical Conflux at (F-5) for this
    objective if you have little to no progress with Voidwatch.
  - Use the Survival Guide to teleport to Pashhow Marshlands (S) and use
    the Veridical Conflux at (J-9) to enter and head east then south
    (This option does require progression through Voidwatch expansion).
  - OR, enter from Grauberg (S) at (F-5) then head south.
  - OR, if you have obtained the Lightsworm, you may use any blue ???
    near the Cavernous Maws surrounding Jeuno (past or present) to zone
    into Walk of Echoes, then head south to the Blank Target. May not
    work if you are on Somber Dreams.

When you have collected the 8th dawndrop, they will combine to give you
the Primal glow.

  { title = "Maiden of the Dusk", walkthrough = [[Walkthrough

- Examine the Veridical Conflux in Grauberg (S) at (F-5) for a cutscene.
  You will be transported to Walk of Echoes.
  - If Walk of Echoes was the last dawndrop you did from the last
    mission, you must exit and examine the Veridical Conflux for the
    cutscene.
- Examine the Ornate Door north of the Verdical Conflux in the Walk of
  Echoes for a cutscene; examine it again to enter the BC Maiden of the
  Dusk.
- Your opponent in this BC is Lilith; she casts AoE enfeebling spells,
  and has two forms.
  - In the first form:
    - Her regular melee attacks are AoE and cause knockback, and she has
      a weaponskill with the additional effect of Dispel.
    - Aside from AoE enfeebling spells, she casts Comet, and at low HP,
      Meteor.
    - She can use Trance multiple times. While under trance, she can use
      a gaze weaponskill called Fatal Attraction which will charm; this
      can be avoided by turning away from her.
    - After defeating the first form, there will be a cutscene and you
      will return to the entry point of the battlefield to rest and buff
      again if needed.
  - In her second form:
    - Her weaponskills are Dark Flare, Dark Burst, Dark Quake, Dark
      Freeze, Dark Tornado; they are conal attacks that do sizable
      amounts of damage.
    - She also has a weaponskill called Dark Moon that causes Weakness
      for a short period of time.
    - She summons Elemental Gyves which can be nuked down fairly easily.
      Avoid standing in them when possible.
      - Red gives Burn and Attack Down.
      - Cyan gives Frost and Magic Attack Down.
      - Yellow gives Rasp and Defense Down.
      - Green gives Choke and Evasion Down.
      - Blue gives Drown and Magic Defense Down.
      - Purple gives Shock and Accuracy Down.
      - White gives Dia and Disease.
      - Black gives Bio and a 5 second Doom effect. Two appear after
        Dark Moon. Be especially careful of this one.
    - Her two hour is Dark Sun; it is AoE Death in approximately a 15
      yalm radius. She will say a line before she uses it, so be
      prepared to run when she is under 50%.
  - Both phases are rather trivial at ilvl 119, but advise caution on
    Fatal Attraction.
- The mission will be complete after a 10 minute cutscene with Lady
  Lilith, Lilisette and Cait Sith.
  - After this cutscene, you may buy the HTMB KI Maiden phantom gem for
    10 Merit Points.
- If you are defeated, wait for the next game day and check the
  Grauberg (S) Veridical Conflux to get another Primal glow.

Walkthrough

Utilize 20 or more Imprimaturs on completed Coalition Assignments.

- Depending on Fame you will get the cutscene sooner with less
  Imprimaturs used. 30+ with lots of Quests done, 50+ with a few Quests
  done, or 60+ with very few Quests (or none at all) done.
  - July 2020 note: it's likely the requirements have been lowered; was
    able to get with fewer than 30 Imprimaturs and just 2 or 3 Quests
    done).
  - Fame can be checked at the NPC Iyvah Halohm in Eastern Adoulin at
    (G-8).
    - You can progress the Mission with 20 Imprimaturs spent and Rank 2
      Fame (9 Quests completed. The six colonization skills found here.
      The two Waypoint quests in town Wes...Eastern Waypoints, Ho!,
      Western Waypoints, Ho!, and The Old Man and the Harpoon.
    - You can progress the Mission with 16 Imprimaturs spent and Rank 4
      Fame.
    - You can progress the Mission with 3 Imprimaturs spent and Rank 8
      Fame. (An easy way to cap Fame is by repeating the questline
      starting with It Sets My Heart Aflutter. From Level 1 Fame it
      takes about 4 Stacks of Twitherym Wing, and 2 stacks of Velkk
      Necklace and Umbril Ooze to get to Level 8.)
    - You can progress this mission with 0 Imprimaturs spent with Maxed
      Rank 9 Fame (Approx. 6 Stacks of Twitherym Wing, and 3 stacks of
      Velkk Necklace and 3 stacks of Umbril Ooze to get to Level 9.)
- Upon completing that, you also gain the ability to purchase Key Items
  that allow for participation in Wildskeeper Reives, battling against
  the Naakuals.
  - These can be purchased from Dimmian in Eastern Adoulin (E-6).
- Talk to Brenton for a cutscene to complete the mission and receive the

  this Mission.
  - At this point, begin the quest Flavors of Our Lives and get to the

    to do this.

Walkthrough

Use a certain number of Imprimaturs and then speak to Levil in the
Pioneers' Coalition to complete this Mission and start the next.

- The Imprimatur requirement can be fulfilled prior to this Mission, in
  which case the next Mission can be started on the next game day.
  - You may continue this Mission by meeting a total of completing
    Coalition Assignments (measured by total Imprimaturs spent on them)
    along with achieving a certain level of Adoulin Fame.

Summary of testimonials from the discussion page provide some
approximate totals players need to meet in terms of
contributions/accomplishments for Adoulin before advancing:

  Completed Assignments (in Imprimaturs)   Adoulin Fame level

  11 ( ≈2.5 earth-days worth)              9 (Hero)

  32                                       2
  36 ( ≈9 earth-days worth)                1 (No Fame)

  : Imprimaturs and Fame

Actual minimums may be below these, and would require testing via
multiple characters for additional certainty.

Individual quest completions in Adoulin may also contribute to being
able to flag the next cutscene in addition to Imprimaturs-spent and
overall fame (by repeatable quests), as some users have experienced
completing an additional quest allowing them to advance even when their
fame/imprimaturs remains unaltered. Nonetheless, the above estimates
should prove useful to players looking to proceed - just complete more
assignments and quests until talking to Levil triggers the cutscene.

Remember that you receive 1 imprimatur every 6 real-life hours, and you
can hold up to 15 at once. You can spend them to bank them if you can't
complete the assignments right away.

For quick coalition assignments:

- A quick and easy way to accomplish this is to farm/buy stacks of
  Bloodthread and simply repeat the Gather Materials: Rala Waterways
  Task in the Inventors' Coalition. All that is required is to accept
  the task, trade 3 Bloodthread to the Task Delegator, then talk to the
  Task Delegator again to finish. Rinse and Repeat!
- Another method is to do simple delivery assignments from the Couriers'
  Coalition. You can walk out to the waypoint, teleport to a bivouac and
  talk to the administrator for the delivery, and then come back to the
  Courier's guild for easy completions.

For quick repeatable-quest fame:

-  trio of repeatable quests using item turn-ins. You may be able to
  find these on the AH in sufficient quantities to streamline this -
  setting your Home Point to HP#1 in Eastern Adoulin may also be
  helpful.

For general Adoulin quests to bolster your accomplishments in the area:

- Adoulin Quests

Going Forward

- Continue using your Imprimaturs, as you'll need higher requirements
  for a future mission
- You can 'bank' them if you can't get to them by accepting assignments
  and then cancelling them later, as you get a full refund.
  - Also if you're short on time, inventor's can be done fully with the
    AH, and Courier's can be done fully with waypoints.
- You'll need to diligent about doing assignments to rank everything up
  to Legend if:
  - you want to unlock Ergon Weapons (GEO's Idris & RUN's Epeolatry -
    very useful for those jobs)
  - you want the Golden shovel cordon, the prerequisite for the Adoulin
    epilogue questline which rewards the ability to upgrade the player's
    chosen scenario ring to the +1 version (example) and grants a
    special healer trust.

Walkthrough

[Cirdas Caverns|thumbnail|right]

- Travel to Cirdas Caverns and head towards the Ergon Locus at (E-9) for
  a cutscene.
  - The Ergon Locus is blocked by a Colonization Reive requiring
    \"Logging\"
- After viewing the cutscene you can now continue Tears of the Generals
  (Rhapsodies of Vanadiel Mission 3-6).

Routes

- Some suggested route options on making your way there:
  - minimal colonization reives and survival skills needed:
    - Ceizak Battlegrounds WP #3 -> Southwest to Sih Gates -> West to
      Cirdas Caverns, starting in the southeast corner (with one lair
      reive along the way)
  - less cave navigation:
    - Foret de Hennetiel WP #3 -> clear the colonization reive to the
      north to cross the water -> Dho Gates -> one-way drop into Cirdas

You must have both the \"Watercrafting\" and \"Climbing\" survival skills to
reach Yorcia Weald from Cirdas Caverns.

- See Survival Skills.

Walkthrough

- Zone into Yorcia Weald for a cutscene
  - You may use a waypoint or the Home Point to Yorcia Weald to trigger
    this cutscene.

Alternate Route

- This route should not be done your first time experiencing Ulbuka!
  Learn Survival Skills instead.
  - It's also possible to get here initially by a back route requiring
    minimal survival skills so long as Escape can be used, often by
    subbing /BLM. By entering Woh Gates from Morimar Basalt Fields
    southwest of WP #4, you can then Escape and wind up at the end of
    Yorcia Weald close to WP #3 there. This all can be done solo without
    either \"Watercrafting\" or \"Climbing\", just Demolishing is required
    for 1 colonization reive in Morimar Basalt Fields if there is no one
    around to clear it for you.

Walkthrough

[]

- Obtain a Yorcia's tear via one of two methods:
  - Option 1: Click on the Ergon Locus ??? at the southern part of (I-8)
    in Yorcia Weald.
    - You must enter (I-8) from the West, but there is occasionally a
      wall that blocks the path. The path opens at 21:00.
    - There is also another Ergon Locus and a ??? in the northern part
      of (I-8), but neither of those are the correct location. You need
      to use the one mentioned above entering (I-8) from the west.
  - Option 2: Harvest by using a Sickle on a Harvesting Point.
    - Bring extra Sickles as they may break before obtaining the key
      item. Harvesting with a full inventory will prevent you from
      receiving normal items; however, Harvesting Points will still be
      used while attempting for the key item.
    - Harvesting Points can be scarce, and will despawn and respawn
      elsewhere after a set amount of time. Option 1 is much easier.
- Go to (G-6) after obtaining your Yorcia's tear and click the Pellucid
  Afflusion next to the pond for a cutscene.
  - There is a bush at the corner of (G-5/6)-(H-5/6) that moves up and
    down blocking the path at times. It seems to move up and down every
    5 to 10 minutes.
    - This was back when colonization levels were a lot lower, while
      hovering around 80% they don't pop up often.
- After the cutscene, you will obtain the Rosulatia's pome.

Notes

The Ergon Locus ??? was added after this Mission was implemented due to
complaints on how difficult it was to obtain the key item from
harvesting.

- Was unable to receive the KI from the Ergon Locus itself or the ???
  when on this mission in 2025
- Got the KI on first try via Harvesting Point with a Sickle

Walkthrough

- Enter Rala Waterways for a cutscene.
  - The closest entrance to the destination is via Western Adoulin at
    (F-5) which is closest to the Adoulin Waterfront Waypoint.
- Proceed south to the dead end at (C-6) and click the Sluice Gate.
  Enter the password which can be determined from the clues in this
  Mission and the previous mission (case sensitive, enter it in all
  capitals) to start a cutscene.
  - Hints: [The password is four letters and hinted at on a marked page
    in the history book in the library and upon zoning into Rala
    Waterways.]
  - Solution: [The password is the first initial of each order leader on
    the marked library page. These are the four leaders who voted
    against the Colonization effort.]
  - Password: [HGSI - the initials of the leaders Hildebert, Gratzigg,
    Svenja, and Ikhi Askamot.]
  - If you enter the incorrect password too many times, you will be
    locked out of entering the password until after you return to the
    library and read the History book again.
- Once the cutscene is completed you will receive the Note detailing
  seditious plans.
  - If you failed to repeat the password correctly during the cutscene
    (after being challenged upon choosing the conversationally incorrect
    response \"It could increase crops threefold!\") you will need to
    click the door once more to get the Key Item. This needs to be
    entered in upper-case as well or they will still proclaim \"We have a
    spy among us! Off with [his/her] head!\". You will get a different
    scene after you interact with the Sluice Gate again, where The

Walkthrough

[Rala Sluice Gate to Storage Container walk|thumb]

- Head to (H-6) in Rala Waterways, and retrieve the Waterway facility
  crank from the Storage Container.
  - If you already are in Rala Waterways at the Sluice Gate from the
    last mission and have easy access to the Sneak status, it's faster
    just to run there directly. No need for invisible in this area.
  - If you're coming from town, this is most easily accessed via Western
    Adoulin (K-8) from the Big Bridge Waypoint.

- Return to the Sluice Gate (C-6) for a cutscene.
- Click the Sluice Gate to enter the area behind the gate.
  - If progress in Rhapsodies of Vanadiel is at Rhapsodies of Vanadiel
    Mission 3-8, the Inconspicuous Barrel is immediately on the right in
    the corner.
- Click the Antiquated Sluice Gate to enter the battlefield: Behind the
  Sluices (Battle).
  - If you fail the fight you will have to run back to the storage
    container at (H-6) for another Waterway facility crank.

- Notes for those assisting with the fight already completing it:
  - - They do not need a Waterway facility crank.
    - They also don't need to be near the Antiquated Sluice Gate - just
      somewhere in the zone, and they'll be teleported instantly when
      the fight begins.
    - The reward message You have obtained 15000 bayld! seems to display
      only intermittently (rarely appearing even with no log filtering),
      but comparing bayld before-and-after the fight shows that the
      reward occurs even out the message.
    - The party leader needs to be on the mission and needs to be the
      one interacting with the Antiquated Sluice Gate, but the leader
      can be changed once the battle begins to improve trust selection.
    - The fight can be repeated for the bayld bonus as soon as finishing
      it, prior to leaving the zone even while this mission is still
      active.
      - A party can split up and go through one-by-one, repeating the
        fight with the next person. The last person to go through won't
        get a reward, but each other player would get rewards based on
        the number of times they repeated it.

The Battle

- You fight against four enemies.
- All four enemies run to a random target to perform weapon skills,
  regardless of hate.
  - This causes skillchains to happen on players so take care.
- Alter Ego Trusts may be summoned in this fight.
- At 119 this fight is not a problem with 5 Trusts.
  - Mileage may vary, see \"coldReactive's RDM Trust Solo Testimonial\" on
    the discussion page.

- You fight alongside Arciela!
  - Arciela will buff herself with Stoneskin, Protect V, and Shell V.
  - Arciela will engage the enemies on her own after a player readies
    their battle stance (takes weapons out), but will stay put until
    then.
  - Arciela can hold her own well, but will require healing. If she
    dies, you'll fail the mission.
  - Valaineral can be useful to hold hate off of her due to Uriel Blade.

- Each round is played by either \"shooting\", \"staying\", using a trick,

- Shooting increases your roll in the same manner that a Corsair's
  Phantom Roll works.
  - Just like with Corsair's rolls, getting more than 11 total will
    cause you to \"bust\", and thus lose the round.
- Staying closes the round for you.
  - Either play may stay while the other player may continue.
  - When both players stay, the round ends and whoever has the highest
    number closest to 11 wins.
- Using a trick does one of three things:
  - You may only use one trick per round.
  - Peeking lets you look at one roll of the opponent.
  - Swapping lets you change one of your rolls for one of the

In order to progress through the Rhapsodies of Vana'diel without
interruption, your character must have progressed to the following
missions below in other expansions:

- Obtain Rank 6 in your home nation by completing Rank Mission 5-2.
- Progress in Rise of the Zilart until your current mission is Headstone
  Pilgrimage.
- Progress in Chains of Promathia until your current mission is The Road
  Forks.
- Progress in Treasures of Aht Urhgan until your current mission is
  Royal Puppeteer.
- Progress in Wings of the Goddess until your current mission is In the
  Name of the Father.
- Progress in Seekers of Adoulin until your current mission is Behind
  the Sluices and you have the Waterway facility crank.

:*Note - 2 different Seekers of Adoulin missions that are prerequisite
to RoV require you to spend a certain number of imprimaturs to progress.
These are time based currencies that don't start accumulating until you
visit Adoulin and talk to a Task Delegator. This is the only time gated
content required to finish RoV aside from the usual \"wait a game day\"
between missions. So plan accordingly if you are trying to line up how
you do your other missions to complete RoV.

Zone into any of the three starter cities with a character that is Level
3 or higher and you will receive a brief cutscene.

- If you meet the requirements to get the cutscene and are not getting
  it when zoning in, then (typically very early in your journey into
  starting the game) you chose the option to \"watch this cutscene later\"
  when you got the cutscene the first time. You may now start/complete
  this mission/cutscene by interacting with a Tales' Beginning at any of
  these locations:
  - Southern San d'Oria (H-8)
  - Northern San d'Oria (J-10)
  - Port San d'Oria (H-9)
  - Bastok Mines (I-9)

Walkthrough

Complete the path that you started in the previous Mission.

Selbina path

- Purchase from the Auction House or farm 3 Bee Pollen from Huge Wasps
  in La Theine Plateau or Konschtat Highlands.
  - If you choose to farm the Pollen, the best area is in Konschtat
    Highlands around the Crag of Dem. There are about 12-15 spawns that
    you will find as you run around the Crag, and by the time you make a
    lap they will have respawned.
  - In La Theine Plateau, the spawns are spread out with only 3-4 at
    each of the valleys.
  - Be sure to use Wide Scan under your Map menu to help find the Huge
    Wasps.
- Return to Selbina and trade the pollen to Abelard.

Mhaura path

- Purchase from the Auction House or farm 3 Mandragora Dewdrops off the
  Pygmaioi in Tahrongi Canyon.
  - Be sure to use Wide Scan under your Map menu to help find the
    Pygmaioi.
- Return to Mhaura and trade the dewdrops to Ekokoko.

Afterward

If you are a new player and you have not yet unlocked your Support Job
(a.k.a. subjob) you will receive the Gilgamesh's introductory letter. If
you have already unlocked your Support Job, your reward will be a Copper
Voucher.

- Gilgamesh's introductory letter allows you to unlock your Support Job
  easier and earlier than before: After reaching Level 18+, speak to
  either Isacio in Selbina (G-10) twice, or Vera in Mhaura (G-10) twice
  to unlock your Support Job!

Walkthrough

Head to (J-12) in Sea Serpent Grotto and examine the sparkling ??? near
the lake at (J-12) for a cutscene.

There's a couple easy ways to get there, both of which take about the
same amount of time.

Option 1: Just Walk

[]

:*Exit Norg on foot (not chocobo!) to the South (H-10).

:*You're now on Map 1 at (F-1) of Sea Serpent Grotto. Keep following the
tunnel southward until you get to an apparent dead end near a torch at
(H-6).

:* There's a hidden door here that has a blank label when you target it,
and will open it when you interact with it. It's always unlocked - open
it and proceed.

:** (This is usually the entrance you'd need to find when getting into
Norg traditionally.)

:*From here, take an immediate left to go north-east to J-5, and then a
right (southward) to the one-way drop down at K-7. Continue!

:*Now hug the left wall as you go forward, ignoring the ''Ornamented
Door' (J-10) and proceeding down the tunnel to the left, until you reach
a large room (K-11).

:*The sparkling ??? is right in front of you on the edge of the water
(J-12).

Option 2: Unity Warp

:* Use Unity Warp 125 for Sea Serpent Grotto to get to the zone.

:**You may want to Sneak in advance, as Mousse are aggressive to sound
even at level 75+, and do spawn in this stretch.

:*You're now on Map 4 just past what is colloquially called \"Gold Door\"
(it's actually blank when targeted), but you actually want to go back in
its direction toward the Northeast to the other side of it.

You're back on Map 1 at (I-14).

:**Normally if you were coming from the other side you'd need to trade
it a Gold Beastcoin to open it, but you don't need that as you're coming
from the inside.

location for the next mission. You might want to walk there!

The return-route one-way tunnel is located at (H-8), and at the Cracked

Walkthrough

Go to (F-11) in Yuhtunga Jungle and examine the sparkling ??? for a
cutscene.

- The quickest way to F-11 would be to zone out of Norg into Sea Serpent
  Grotto and Escape into Yuhtunga Jungle. When you zone in run out of
  the tunnel and towards the base of the lake.
  - Alternatively, take a chocobo from Marilleune (H-9) in Norg, near
    the exit to Sea Serpent Grotto and ride to the ???.
- Alternatively use the lvl 119 Unity Wanted Encounter teleport to
  Yuhtunga Jungle, which also places you near the exit to Sea Serpent
  Grotto, as above.

Notes

On your way to Yuhtunga Jungle, you should make sure to get the Survival
Guide at the zone exit.

Walkthrough

- Examine the blue glowing ??? near the Veridical Conflux in
  Grauberg (S) to spawn Cetus.
  - The correct ??? is NE of the Veridical Conflux and not the one right
    beside it.
  - Note: Cetus gains Dread Spikes after Aetheric Pull, so beware if

  the Veridical Conflux.
- Note: If you brought some sort of warp as mentioned in the previous
  mission, warp back into town.

Notes

- This fight is intended for players that are 99. If you attempt this
  fight below 99 you may die.
  - A solo player with Trusts can complete this in the early level 90s
    with some difficulty.
- In the event you wipe, you will no longer be able to go back and
  re-enter by clicking the ??? beside a Cavernous Maw. You will need to
  walk to Grauberg (S) manually.
  - If you don't have a Survival Guide directly to Pashhow
    Marshlands (S) or North Gustaberg (S) (zones directly connected to
    Grauberg) follow as such:
    - If you have Rolanberry Fields (S) use it and follow beneath the
      next step.
    - Otherwise take the Survival Guide to Vunkerl Inlet (S) and make
      your way to (H-11). This will take you off map and eventually
      you'll come to a drop at (I-11) you want to take to move towards
      (J-12), zoning you into Rolanberry Fields (S).
    - Make your way down to (I-14), grab the Survival Guide, and zone
      into Pashhow Marshlands (S).
    - This zone is exactly the same as the present (except there's no
      Konschtat Highlands yet so the zone is barricaded off). No
      surprise walls, so head to (G-10) and start hugging the left. This
      will take you off map to (G-11) where you'll hit the zone line for
      Grauberg (S).
- To make your way back to the ???, just head to (F-5) (G/H-6 is a one
  way drop, so you need to go the longer way).
- Touch the ??? again for a quick CS
- Return to the Walk of Echoes for CS
  - To get the last cutscene, you must be on a Wings of the Goddess
    mission where Lilisette is available.

Walkthrough

- Upon entering Escha - Ru'Aun, to the left (next to Dremi) there is a
  ??? that gives you Eschan Droplets item. Afterwards, click on the
  Eschan Portal to get to the next one.
  - At each portal, you need to look around for ??? and obtain another
    Eschan Droplet. This will allow you to teleport to the next one.
    Repeat this process until you've reached Portal #15. The location of
    each ??? is as follows:
    - Eschan Portal #2 — At the end of the only path. (Next to the door,
      don't use the one in front of the teleport).
    - Eschan Portal #3 — Up the first staircase near the pillar to the
      right.
    - Eschan Portal #4 — Across the bridge, between the two large
      pillars to the left.
    - Eschan Portal #5 — At the end of the only path. (Next to the door,
      don't use the one in front of the teleport).
    - Eschan Portal #6 — Southern (G-6), walk past and underneath the
      second staircase, and it is on the bridge with the closed door.
    - Eschan Portal #7 — (F-5), Directly left of the second bridge.
    - Eschan Portal #8 — At the end of the only path.
    - Eschan Portal #9 — Head up both sets of stairs and turn left. Make
      another left at the bridge crossing the water. The ??? is in the
      middle of this area.
      - The Gargoyles will aggro at night time if you walk too close to
        their alcoves.
    - Eschan Portal #10 — Across both bridges, at the south-west side of
      the last platform.
    - Eschan Portal #11 — At the end of the only path.
    - Eschan Portal #12 — Sneak up then proceed up both sets of stairs,
      and turn right. Keep moving until you see a staircase on the left,
      and run past it. The ??? is past the staircase, at (J-7).
    - Eschan Portal #13 — Across the first bridge, next to the first
      large pillar to the left.
    - Eschan Portal #14 — At the end of the only path.
      - This process is not restricted to this mission and can be
        completed at any time after you've gained entry access to the
        zone.
      - If you have difficulty finding the ??? on a certain island, you
        can also go back to the start and pick up a new Eschan Droplets
        from the ???, then pay silt to use the Eschan Portal and use the
        new KI to continue unlocking portals.

- Click on the shining ??? at Portal #15 for a cutscene.

Walkthrough

- Enter Walk of Echoes for a cutscene.
  - All three zoning methods listed below lead to the same section of
    the Walk of Echoes. The first one is the most easily accessible.

  - If you zone in from Xarcabard (S), you will need to exit after the
    cutscene and go to one of the other locations for the next mission
    as this is the wrong Walk of Echoes.

  - If you receive the message, \"You are unable to make further progress
    in Rhapsodies of Vana'diel due to an event occurring in the quest
    Champion of the Dawn,\" then you must zone into Walk of Echoes from
    Xarcabard (S) to activate and receive the cut scene for Champion of
    the Dawn and you must complete that quest and then A Forbidden
    Reunion first. You will not receive the Rhapsodies of Vana'diel 3-14
    cutscene upon re-entering Walk of Echoes after completing these
    quests, and you may simply proceed to the next Mission.

Entering the Walk of Echoes

Method 1:

- Warp from one of the glowing blue ??? next to the Cavernous Maws in
  Batallia Downs, Rolanberry Fields, and Sauromugue Champaign.
  - Requires the Lightsworm, acquired during Wings of the Goddess
    Mission 2, Back to the Beginning, or during the early RoV Mission
    line.
  - This depends on if the player completed Back to the Beginning before
    August 2015. The Lightsworm was introduced in the August 2015
    Version Update Changes.

Method 2:

- The Verdical Conflux in Grauberg (S) at (F-5).
  - Requires Wings of the Goddess Mission 46: When Wills Collide.

Method 3:

- The Verdical Conflux in Pashhow Marshlands (S) at (J-9).
  - Requires Voidwatch Quest 15: Glimmer of Hope''.

Walkthrough

- Find a nearby white glowing ??? to receive a cutscene.
  - If you entered the Walk of Echoes via a blue ??? or the Veridical
    Conflux in Batallia Downs, Rolanberry Fields, Sauromugue Champaign
    or Grauberg (S), the glowing ??? will be to the east.
    - This is the same for the Lightsworm entrance.

  - If you entered the Walk of Echoes via the Veridical Conflux in
    Pashhow Marshlands (S), the glowing ??? will be to the east.

  - If you entered the Walk of Echoes through Xarcabard (S), then you
    are in the wrong section of the zone. See the previous Mission for
    directions to the correct entrances.
- You will then be teleported to Desuetia - Empyreal Paradox and receive
  Cait Sith's whisker.
- The Mission will automatically complete after you enter the area.

  Like the Future battle.
  - If you lose the fight, obtain another Cait Sith's whisker from Cait
    Sith outside of the BCNM.

Battle

You will fight Sempurne.

- Sempurne itself is a \"weakened\" version of Shinryu from Abyssea -
  Empyreal Paradox.
- Sempurne uses all of Shinryu's abilities without the added ability to
  recover HP from taking damage while readying TP moves or Casting
  Magic.
- Easily soloable with Trusts as an iLvl DD Job.

Directions to Sempurne

- Here's how to get to Sempurne. This is useful if you are not in the
  middle of the Quest line and are only coming to learn Mighty Guard or
  help another player.
- Proceed to a Cavernous Maw.
  - The Batallia Downs Maw at (H-5) is the most accessible as it is
    right next to the Survival Guide.
    - Otherwise, the maw in Rolanberry Fields at (H-6) (also next to a
      Survival Guide) is a quick Mount ride from the Lower Jeuno Home
      Point #1 (E).
- Click the blue ??? right next to the Cavernous Maw.
- This will zone you into Walk of Echoes.
- Run forward and to the right (north-east) to the white ??? and click
  it.
- This will zone you into Desuetia - Empyreal Paradox.
- Run straight ahead, and click on Transcendental Radiance to enter the
  Sempurne fight.

Walkthrough

- Return to Reisenjima and examine the ??? at (H-5) (on the hill near
  the large ruins) for a cutscene.
  - If you receive a message about a Tribulens you are at the wrong ???.
    It is the one immediately adjacent to the ruins not the one further
    down the hill.
  - Warp to Ethereal Ingress #5 and run west along the path. Be wary of
    True Sight Hippogryphs.

Notes

- You will be unable to receive this cutscene if you are currently on
  one of the following missions:
  - Promathia Mission 8-1: Garden of Antiquity
  - Promathia Mission 8-4: Dawn (prior to final cutscenes)
  - Possibly other Tenzen-related missions

Walkthrough

- Defeat 11 Obstreperous Panopts.
  - Many spawn around (F-11) -- just north of Ethereal Ingress #1.
  - They are not difficult to defeat, but the area is full of other
    aggressive mobs.
  - Players should purchase a Mollifier KI from Shiftrix prior to
    completing this Mission otherwise the NM Ascended Panopt can spawn.
  - Zoning will reset your progress. You will receive a message
    informing you how many remain upon each kill.
  - Thanks to the June 2016 version update, the \"Rhapsody in Fuschia\"
    will reduce the level of any Obstreperous Panopts claimed by the
    player while on this mission.
    - Appears to decrease the Panopts to level 112, regardless of their
      initial starting level (122~124).
  - Record of Eminence, Combat (Region), Combat (Escha 2), Conflict:
    Reisenjima I is killing ten of these.

Walkthrough

- Check the Transcendental Radiance in Empyreal Paradox and enter the
  battlefield \"The Winds of Time\".
- You will have to fight and defeat Metus.
  - Metus can use Promathia's TP moves, including : Bastion of Twilight,
    Wheel of Impregnability, Infernal Deliverance, Empty Salvation.
  - Metus can also use Osmotic Wave, Censure.
  - Metus can cast Meteor.
  - Trust NPCs can be used for this battle.
- After winning the battle, a cutscene will start along with the next
  Mission.

Notes

- Upon failure, return to Reisenjima Sanctorium and click the Reisen
  Crystal, agree to meet the Goddess and you will return to Empyreal
  Paradox for a cutscene with Metus. After head into the room with the
  \"Transendental Radiance\" and there is a \"Dimensional Portal\" to the
  right of the entrance, use this to return to Reisenjima Sanctorium.
- Then click the \"Reisenjima Crystal\", agree to meet the Goddess again
  and you will be given the Extradimensional scar required to attempt
  the fight again.
  - This capability is lost when you're no longer on a RoV mission
    requiring access to Empyreal Paradox.
  - If you haven't reached Dawn in Chains of Promathia, you will be
    confined to the basement. There are no free trips to Al'Taieu.

Fight Notes

Ally

- You are assisted by Iroha, who will engage and pull when you move
  forward slightly or engage.
  - Iroha will cast an AoE Protect V and Shell V as the battle starts.
    Then will cast Flare and Flare II throughout the fight and
    eventually Embrava.
  - If defeated, Iroha will Arise herself an unlimited number of times.
  - Arise will place a 4-5m weakened state on you after you accept. Be
    aware of your HP before charging back in due to its reduced nature
    from weakness.
  - Trusts can be resummoned after accepting Arise as long as you do not
    gain enmity, so running off after accepting will hopefully allow you
    to resummon trusts.
  - Iroha will cast Arise as needed on some players within 30'. Not all
    players will be raised, though. Probably only those that are on the
    mission and not helping out.

Enemy

- Cloud of Darkness uses heavy damage conal magic/breath TP moves.
  - If using a Trust tank, re-position so it doesn't hit most of your
    other Trusts.
- Seems to absorb elemental damage based on the weather which changes
  often.
- Changes which elemental magics are cast based on the current weather
  effect, and will also spam elemental magic to the current day,
  especially during light weather since it has no light based magics.
- Begins absorbing either physical or magical damage after using
  Primordial Surge, an AoE move which draws-in nearby players, drains
  300~700 HP from all players and upwards of over 3,000 HP from Iroha.
  - The gem on its head will glow red during this phase.
  - Watch Iroha's combat style to determine which damage type is being
    absorbed.
    - During Physical absorption, Iroha will cease physical attacks and
      will frequently cast Fire VI and Flare spells.
    - During (Light) Magic absorption, Iroha will only use physical
      attacks.
    - There's a third absorption type where Iroha will continue to weave
      physical attacks and Fire spells, with neither of those being
      absorbed. It could be absorbing Darkness-Water-Ice-Earth magic
      damage or Breath damage instead.
  - Phase will end after using Waning Vigor.
    - The damage increases in power as the Cloud of Darkness absorbs
      damage. Players should be using the correct damage type during
      this phase to avoid being one-shotted.
    - Waning Vigor will apply Weakness (15s) to the tank after it deals
      damage. Iroha may cast Embrava when the weakness wears off.
    - This absorb phase may be canceled by dispelling the buffs it
      absorbs.
    - At >25% Waning Vigor is replaced by a stronger version of the same
      move named Expunge which replaces the weakness with a full dispel.

Lore

- In this mission, Iroha is able to use a new technique, Amatsu: Kyori,
  a Far Eastern technique which can be used for dispelling enchantments.
  - Iroha trained with Final Fantasy XIV's Warrior of Light to master
    this technique during a crossover event that started at the same
    time Rhapsodies of Vana'diel Chapter 3 released (Nov. 9 or 10,
    2015). Based on the date of the event and usage of the technique,
    the crossover event likely took place prior to this mission. FFXIV
    establishes that other shards experience time dilation, i.e. days in
    one world could be years in another, so it's unclear how long Iroha
    was abroad from either world's perspective. For more details: see
    The Maiden's Rhapsody.

|Reward= *20,000-22,000 Gil |Image= }}

Walkthrough

- Speak to Gumbah in Bastok Mines HP #3 (J-7).
- Speak to Brygid in Bastok Markets HP #4 (K-9) twice.
- After agreeing to assist her, Brygid will instruct you to select one
  of a list of NPCs to cosplay for her fashion show's contest.

NPC Outfits

You are to attempt to dress like your selected NPC exactly, ignoring any
weapons and focusing on head/body/hands/legs/feet. The list includes:

- Azima:
  - Azima is impossible to copy. Her present-day clothing is completely
    unobtainable for players.
    - If attempting to copy her past style from the Shadowreign era
      however, she was wearing a Witch Hat, Marduk's Jubbah, Marduk's
      Dastanas, Marduk's Shalwar, and Sorcerer's Sabots.
  - Cosplaying as Azima from the past will win you first prize, netting
    you an extra 2,000 Gil.
  - A /lockstyle combination of Coven Hat, Marduk's Jubbah, Mdk.
    Dastanas +1, Mdk. Shalwar +1, and Arch. Sabots +1 only earned 20,202
    Gil for first place.

- Naji:
  - Gavial Mail, Breeches, and Battle Boots. No head or hand wear.

- Black Mud:
  - Wool Hat, Doublet, Slops, and Ash Clogs. No hand wear.

    - This is another easy option. Doublet and Slops can be bought from
      a Sparks vendor. The Wool Hat can be purchased from Chetak in
      Lower Jeuno (H-9).

- Michea:
  - Gambison, Brais, Gaiters. No head or hand wear.

- Nbu Latteh:
  - Bronze Harness, Scale Cuisses, and Scale Greaves. No head or hand
    coverings.

    - This is the easiest and cheapest outfit to copy. All 3 pieces of
      this armor are available for ~3,000 from vendors at Brunhilde
      Armorer in Bastok Markets HP #1 (E-10), or also available from
      Sparks for a very low cost.

- Once you have made your selection, head outside The Steaming Sheep in
  Port Bastok HP #3 (E-7) and speak to Ruenda while wearing your costume
  (make sure to either /lockstyle off or create an Equip. Set).
  - This is a long cutscene, 5+ minutes with fastCS and Enternity.
- After the cutscene, speak to Brygid once more to receive your reward.

Notes

- If working multiple accounts simultaneously, any tradeable gear can be
  passed along to alts:
  - Set and enable the lockstyle with the intended gear outside of The
    Steaming Sheep (will not persist through zone), trade the gear to
    the next character, repeat as needed.

|       skill.                                                             |
| - You will need a Lamian Fang Key.                                       |
|   - Note: You can obtain a Lamian Fang Key by examining the ??? once per |
|     game day at (I-7) in Caedarva Mire map 1.                            |
|     - In the vicinity of the small pond containing Jnun, near the        |
|       entrance to Arrapago Reef.                                         |
|     - The survival guide teleport to Arrapago Reef and running south     |
|       will exit to Caedarva Mire I-6.                                    |
|     - Alternatively, escape will from Arrapago Reef will put you in      |
|       Caedarva Mire I-6 as well.                                         |
|   - Note: Thief can use Skeleton Key and or Thief Tools to open the      |

| - Head to Arrapago Reef and interact with the ??? at the North East      |
|   corner of (H-10) on a ship for a cutscene to begin the mission. (Note: |
|   The ??? is in the front of the ship next to a shining point near three |
|   barrels.)                                                              |
|   - Easiest via the Arrapago Reef Survival Guide, or with the Azouph     |
|     Isle Staging Point (Leujaoam Sanctum), and then zone into Arrapago   |
|     Reef at (I-6).                                                       |
|     - From there, move towards (J-10) with a Lamian Fang Key to open the |
|       door. Trade the key, and quickly cross through.                    |
|     - Hug the left wall on this cavern map. You will exit through a door |
|       back to the first map, and you'll you reach (H-10).                |
|   - The ??? target is the same for the Corsair job quest. The correct CS |
|     mentions Pteraketos and Sealord Skin.                                |
| - After the cutscene head to Map 3 of Arrapago Reef (F-7) trade a Hamsi  |
|   to the Apkallu Guide for a cutscene.                                   |
|   - The fastest way to get to this location is to warp out and use a     |
|     Survival Guide Teleport to Caedarva Mire then immediately enter the  |
|     cave into Arrapago Reef.                                             |
|   - Note: If you don't have the Mire Survival Guide you will need        |
|     another Lamian Fang Key to reach it.                                 |
|                                                                          |

| - Either walk from the prior mission cutscene area or return to town and |
|   warp to Ilrusi Atoll Staging Point.                                    |
|   - From the ship you are on now (Map 1):                                |
|   - Proceed to (F-10) to cross over to Map 2 (B).                        |
|     - This is the same map as if you take the Ilrusi Atoll Staging       |
|       Point, and the paths converge at the next point.                   |
|   - Proceed to (D-10) to cross over to Map 3 (C).                        |
|   - Continue to (F-9) to use a Lamian Fang Key on door \"e\".              |
|   - Through the gate, turn right and go through another gate.            |
|   - Wind your way around to (F-6) and zone to obtain the Survival Guide  |
|     warp in the Mire. You will need it for the next mission too.         |
|   - Return to the Reef to (F-7) to trade a Hamsi to the Apkallu Guide    |
|     for a cutscene and resume the mission.                               |
|                                                                          |

| - After the cutscene with the Apkallu Guide, head west and click the     |
|   Camp Remnants (F-7) to begin a confrontation with:                     |
| - 2 Merrow Kabukidancers ^((SAM))                                        |
| - 2 Qutrub ^((DRK))                                                      |
| - 2 Mamool Ja Divers (Sahagin) ^((MNK))                                  |
|   - Trusts may be used. Call them BEFORE checking the Camp Remnants.     |
|   - Merrows can strip your gear with Torrent.                            |
|     - Torrent is a move which can be evaded with gear and water specific |
|       evasion.                                                           |
|   - AoEs behaves abnormally in this fight, and simply only hits the      |
|     primary target.                                                      |
|     - Because of this, make sure you're buffed and have on DT equipment  |
|       before popping if you're using trusts.                             |
|       As you'll be taking extra damage since you can't AoE               |
|       sleep/petrify.                                                     |
|       - The foes can still be individually slept if you so choose,       |
|         except for the Qutrubs.                                          |
|         - It is overall not a difficult fight at all with a trust        |
|           healer/support and Malignance/Empyrean +2/3 or Nyame R0.       |
| - After the fight, click the Camp Remnants again for a cutscene.         |
|   - FastCS may lock up your client in this cutscene.                     |
|     - The lock occurs at the end of the cutscene after the dialog        |
|       prompt, so you can leave FastCS on until that point.               |
|     - You also want to set your fps to 30 (//config FrameRateDivisor 2)  |
|       if you're having issues.                                           |
|     - Another great way is to run `//lua unloadall` then `//exec         |
|       autoload/autoload`, and it should recover from the frozen          |
|       cutscene, no need to do anything else.                             |
| - Return to the ??? on the Corsair ship at (H-10) Map 1 of Arrapago Reef |
|   for the final cutscene and your reward.                                |
|   - You can obtain another Lamian Fang Key from the ??? in Caedarva Mire |
|     map 1 at (I-7) if the game day has rolled over straight outside of   |
|     Arrapago Reef.                                                       |

| - Proceed to (G-8) in Wajaom Woodlands to examine the Leypoint for a |

|     Warp ⁽¹²⁵⁾.                                                      |
| - Travel to (G-9), where the Hydra usually spawns.                   |
|   - To get here, first go to (E-10) in Wajaom Woodlands, entrance 8  |
|     on the map to enter the Aydeewa Subterrane (Map 3).              |
|     - Voidwatch Warp to Mamook will put you close to this entrance,  |
|       but it's much faster to just run there.                        |
|   - Follow the path, along the left wall the whole way, do not drop  |
|     down, and exit at (J-8).                                         |
|     - This is exit 7 on the map below.                               |
| - Once outside keep going and after the first ledge drop you will be |
|   in an open area.                                                   |
|   - If you see raptors or spiders then you went the wrong way in the |
|     Subterrane.                                                      |
| - Equip the Thunder Hammer in your main weapon slot and approach the |
|   Marolith for a cutscene.                                           |
|   - The Marolith is not targetable. If Hydra is up, you can walk     |
|     around it without aggro if you do not want to kill it.           |
|   - You will receive Aeropearl afterwards.                           |
| - Return to the Apkallu Guide in Arrapago Reef (F-7) via the         |

|   - Speaking to Dkhaaya before Ghatsad will give you a mini-cutscene |
|     where he tells you he cannot fix the aeropearl and send you to   |
|     Ghatsad.                                                         |

|   Panaiveriyamman ^((WAR)), an Acrolith NM.                          |
|   - Uses Mighty Strikes, but doesn't hit very hard or accurately in  |
|     general.                                                         |
|   - Resistant to magic, especially dark-based spells, but is very    |
|     susceptible to water damage.                                     |
|   - Has approximately 150k HP.                                       |
|   - Recommended to summon trusts beforehand, the NM can appear       |
|     immediately upon killing any Qiqirn.                             |
|     - You may need to defeat many Qiqirns before Panaiveriyamman     |
|       spawns.                                                        |
|     - Some users report higher spawn rates with melee engagement     |
|       compared to one shot BLU magic, although more data is          |
|       required. See Panaiveriyamman Discussion.                      |
|   - You will receive the Man-made solution after the fight.          |
|     - The key item will drop to everyone in a party/alliance, even   |
|       if you are not on the same map.                                |
| - Return to Ghatsad for a cutscene.                                  |
|   - Note: FastCS may cause you to get stuck on a black screen during |
|     this CS. Unload FastCS or use the prtscr button to unlock from a |
|     soft freeze.                                                     |

| - Return to the Apkallu Guide via the Caedarva Mire Survival Guide   |
|   for the final cutscene and your reward.                            |
|   - Note: FastCS may or may not lock up XI on this cutscene. If you  |
|     do get locked up, attempt prntscn first, if that does not work,  |
|     ctrol/alt/dlt force close screens, relogin under regular         |
|     playonline portal, finish CS then change back to regular         |
|     operations for which you were using before the freeze.           |

Notes

- At this point, you can now open up access to two new Records of
  Eminence objectives. See the NPC Elijah in Upper Jeuno near Home Point
  #1 for more information.

- you will need a Prime Weapon that can deal damage (not the shield or
  instrument) for future missions, so make sure to create one at some
  point.

Starting your Prime Weapon

- Speak to Oggbi in Port Bastok (E-6) Homepoint #3 in the Steaming Sheep
  after the mission for a cutscene.
  - You will receive Uran-Mafran's orb after the cutscene.

  Gallimaufry to choose your Prime Weapon.
  - There is a game day wait afterwards.
  - You can purchase multiple Prime Weapons as long as you have the
    Gallimaufry to do so.

A Word on Choosing Your Weapon

You will need your prime weapon upgraded to stage two to participate in
the final mission fight of this storyline. Your choice will limit the
jobs you can take to that fight.

- The fight is more difficult than every other fight in The Voracious
  Resurgence, and you will probably need the help of other players.

If you do not intend to forge your prime weapon all the way to the final
stage, and you have a support job you may want to use later, it is best
to choose the weapon for that job:

-  for WHM or GEO

-  for BLM, SMN, or SCH

-  for RDM, THF, BRD, or DNC

-  for PLD, BLU, or RDM

  the Valhallan Rift at (G-7) for a cutscene.
- Interact with the Valhallan Rift again to enter a BCNM The Voracious
  Beast fight with Garazu-Horeizu (BLM/RDM).
  - He uses all staff weaponskills, Chainspell paired with -ga IV tier
    nukes, and summons clones of you and the Destiny Destroyers.
    - Only Garazu-Horeizu needs to be defeated.
  - Buffs do not remain after entering the BCNM.
  - Trusts may be used.
  - You will be assisted by the Destiny Destroyers.
    - They will engage and approach the enemy as soon as a party member
      engages.

- After the cutscene, equip your stage 2 prime and Interact with the
  Valhallan Rift again to enter a BCNM The Voracious Beast fight with
  Chaos.
  - Stage 3 and above Prime Weapons do count towards the entry
    requirement.
  - Any weapon can damage Chaos, but weapons other than a second-stage
    prime weapon deal -70% damage and cannot finish off the boss.
  - '''Everyone in the party needs to have their weapon equipped in
    order to queue and enter the fight.
    - Duban and Loughnashade do not meet this requirement.
    - This also applies if a person who cleared the fight is helping.
  - Trusts may be used and resummoned as needed.
  - You will be assisted by Gurebu-Ougrebu and Medada.
  - Chaos seems to regen if not taking damage.
    - ''After taking Chaos's HP low the first time, his HP will be
      invisible, and Gurebu-Ougrebu and Medada will be defeated and
      spawn the first two Profane Circle fetters.
      - Chaos will take severely reduced damage while the fetters are
        alive.
  - You will be assisted by Cornelia (Mythril Musketeer), Lehko Habhoka,
    Ragelise, Fickblix, and Luzaf that spawn one at a time. If they are
    defeated in battle, they will then become an additional fetter.
    - Chaos's Black Sanctus applies a fast-acting Doom effect
      (1-count?). If an NPC is alive, they will sacrifice themselves to
      take the hit.
      - In some situations, this move was used as soon as the NPC
        spawned. It seems to be scripted so you can't be afflicted until
        all NPCs are exhausted.
  - Again, the final hit must come from a prime weapon. If you have a
    tank, having them keep theirs equipped is a good idea for example.
- You will receive Vial of Chaos's blood after the fight.

- Return to the Heroes' Gambit (J-9) in Xarcabard for the final
  cutscene.
  - You can choose to defer picking a ring and come back to the location
    later, but the next mission will be started.
  - Should you reconsider your ring decision, a new one can be obtained
    at zero cost by re-examining the Heroes' Gambit one Conquest tally
    after dropping your current reward ring.
    - If you toss your ring in Xarcabard, you must zone and re-enter
      before the Heroes' Gambit will allow you to choose a new ring.
    - Member of my group dropped their ring on Thursday and immediately
      was able to obtain a new, different ring, so I think as long as
      you haven't obtained a ring this conquest tally, you'll be able to
      get a new one right away.

- Warning: Do NOT select the option \"Ask about the Automaton\" in this
  cut-scene. Speaking with him will start a cutscene, during which you

    convince the thief to have Chai.

  which is actually part of the Azouph Isle map. However, you will need
  to travel through Arrapago Reef to reach it.
- Grab yourself a Lamian Fang Key and zone into the reef from (I-6). The
  key can be acquired from a ??? near a pond a short way from the zone.
- For the reef you are going to need Silent Oils and Prism Powders, sub
  Dancer, or etc.

Walkthrough

- To begin, speak to Brutus at (G-7) on any job level 20 or higher, this
  starts the quest Chocobo on the Loose!.
- Speak to him two more times to start the correct quest, and choose
  \"Nope, never!\".
- Obtain Gausebit Grass x4.
  - They can be purchased from the Auction House under Weapons > Ammo &
    Misc. > Pet Items
  - Can be farmed in Meriphataud Mountains from Crane Flies, or in
    Dangruf Wadi from Wadi Hares.
    - The crane flies are on the northern part of the map - by the
      outpost (and survival guide) or around the entrance to Castle
      Oztroja.
    - There isn't a super close Unity Warp to these locations for
      initial transit if you have yet to get a nearby Survival Guide:
      - The best bet might be the 122 Meriphataud Mountains, though it
        is near to the zone line with Tahrongi Canyon.

            The 125 Sauromugue Champaign is also significantly more
            northward than would be ideal.
      - For Dangruf Wadi, the 75 South Gustaberg warp is closest if you
        don't have the Dangruf Wadi survival guide.
  - Do not confuse this with Gysahl Greens which are sold from the
    stables NPC. They do not work.
- Feed the chocobo standing next to Osker one Gausebit Grass by trading
  it to the chocobo.
  - It is possible to feed the chocobo once every real life minute.
    - Each \"minute\" starts at :00 (rather than counting from the last
      feeding interaction with the chocobo)
  - It will take 6 feeding attempts to complete the quest.
    - The first 2 attempts will automatically fail, and will not consume
      a grass.
  - You can use a macro or chat command to speed up the process:
    /item 'gausebit grass' 
    - Tip: Stand closer to the Chocobo than to Osker and use F8 (or the
      target-closest-NPC button) to re-target the chocobo between
      attempts, as interaction will cause your target to be de-selected
      even if it's locked. If you're using the chat directly, press /
      and then the up arrow to repeat the last command you typed.
- Once the chocobo eats the Gausebit Grass x4, you are presented with a
  Chocobo license.

== Walkthrough == Naja will require you to successfully complete three
mini-games. If you fail any portion, wait one real-life minute and speak
to Naja again.
Trial 1 : Push-ups
*In this trial, you must count three NPCs doing push-ups and determine
who did the least.

- - A reliable and low-tech way to do this is use a piece of paper and
    make a mark in three different sections each time a NPC does a
    push-up.
  - It is either one of the three, or none.

Trial 2 : Sit-ups
*In this trial, you must give a \"message advancement prompt\" with proper
timing as the three NPCs do sit-ups. To pass, you must time at least 9
out of 10 advancements prompts correctly.

- - You must press enter/accept when a sit-up is completely finished.
    - If your timing is correct, you'll hear a sharp whistle. If your
      timing is off, you'll hear a dull whistle. Audio is helpful to
      confirm correct timing, but is not required.
    - Correct timing is when the animation is completely finished.
    - The Windower addon Enternity must be unloaded for this trial, as
      it will repeatedly queue the advancement prompt.
  - You can practice indefinitely with Abquhbah.
  - The real challenge will involve three NPCs with slightly different
    timings. You must press enter/accept when the slowest NPC finishes.

Trial 3 : Running
*In this final trial, you must give prompts to the three NPCs so that
they finish running at the same time.

- - If a NPC falls behind, quickly select their name from the menu to
    blow a whistle to make them catch up.
  - If you select a NPC when they aren't behind, you will be penalized
    and can fail the trial.
  - After the NPCs have stopped running, select \"Not now\" to finish the
    exercise.

Trial 3: BCG

- This game is the same as Rock-Paper-Scissors.
  - You and a foe will each choose a critter.
  - Based on the critters chosen, the round will either be a tie, or a
    win for the player or the foe.
  - In the event of a win, the bomb behind the loser will explode, and
    the loser will lose points.
    - By default, the loser will lose 1 point for losing a round.
    - In the event of a tied round, the bomb behind each player will
      grow, increasing the points lost by 1.
    - When the bomb explodes, its size is set to normal and points lost
      returns to 1.
  - To win, reduce your opponents to 0 points.
- The three critters are Beetle, Crab, and Ghost.
  - Ghosts defeat Beetles.
  - Beetles defeat Crabs.
  - Crabs defeat Ghosts.
    - It is indisputable that Bhoots (especially Kudagitsune) cannot, in
      fact, be defeated by anything. The only logical explanation for
      the fact that they appear to lose to lowly crabs is that the
      Bhoots used in this cutscene are actually a Crab in disguise.
- The first opponent you fight, after a lengthy cutscene, is Arcuhbah.
  - He will repeat a simple repeating sequence of the 3 options. For
    example, if he chooses crab first, his next choice will be beetle or
    ghost, and his third choice will be the remaining critter. His
    fourth choice will be the same as his first, fifth the same as his
    second, and so forth.
- The second opponent you fight is a team-up of Fubruhn and Ugrihd.
  - These two will tip off what their choice will be based on the emote
    they use and their current plan.
    - Nod can either be Beetle (plan 1) or Crab (plan 2). If you don't
      know their current plan, choose Beetle.
    - Laugh can either be Ghost (plan 1) or Beetle (plan 2). If you
      don't know their current plan, choose Ghost.
    - Psych can either be Crab (plan 1) or Ghost (plan 2). IF you don't
      know their current plan, choose Crab.
- The third opponent you fight is the Drill Sergeant.
  - He will use a repeating sequence of 4 choices.
  - Either on every even-numbered round or on every odd-numbered round
    he will pick the same critter.
  - On the other rounds, he will alternate between the 2 critters he
    doesn't pick on even-numbered rounds.
  - For example: Crab, Ghost, Beetle, Ghost, repeat.
  - If he falls below 4 points, he will cheat and restore himself to 4
    points
  - In order to beat him, bring him to 4 points, tie him three times,
    and then win once to K.O. him in one shot.
- The final opponent you fight is Koja Salaheem.
  - The battle will be decided in a single round.
  - Justifiably scared of the undefeatable Bhoot, Koja will always
    choose Crab.
  - Choose Beetle to defeat Koja.
- After winning, wait until the game day changes and zone.
- Talk to Abquhbah between 15:00 and 17:00 game-time to complete the
  quest.

Walkthrough

- After completing Missionary Moblin, talk to Koblakiq at (H-11) to
  begin the quest.
  - You will need to zone out/in after completing Missionary Moblin in
    order to initiate this quest.
- Obtain an Arnica Root if you haven't already.
- Head to Castle Oztroja and go to the Brass Door at (I-8). This door
  has two handles used to open and close the door. One handle is the
  opening switch and the other activates a trap door. To avoid the trap
  door, pull one handle, and immediately run away from the area right in
  front of the door. If you pull the correct switch, the door will open
  and you can run through safely. If you pull the wrong switch, the trap
  door will activate, but you should be out of the way of the trap door
  by then. After the trap door closes, hit the other switch and run
  through safely.
- On the next map, head to (G-7) and go through the exit. On the next
  map, this will take you to an area on a ledge. Walk along the ledge
  north until you see the Daa Bola the Seer at (I-7). Trade the Arnica
  Root to Daa Bola the Seer to initiate a cut-scene.
- After the cut-scene, head back to Oldton Movalpolos and speak with
  Koblakiq.
- After receiving Glittering fragment, head to Beadeaux. Upon entering,
  go to (H-7) to enter the underground tunnels. From here, you can
  either head directly to the exit at (F-8), or you can go to the
  northern part of (G-7) to activate The Mute before heading to the exit
  at (F-8). The Mute is a device that will cast a Silence spell upon
  anyone who touches it. The reason these are important in Beadeaux is
  because there are devices called The Afflictor that will curse anyone
  who goes near it. These are unavoidable at many times. Your options
  are to either silence yourself with The Mute so that you can bypass
  The Afflictor unaffected, or to allow yourself to be cursed by going
  by The Mute while not silenced. The silence effect from The Mute can
  be removed by Silena, Echo Drops or Benediction and the curse from The
  Afflictor can be removed by Cursna, Holy Water, or Benediction,
  although the use of Benediction in this scenario is not recommended.
  Also, the effects will wear off by themselves after a certain period
  of time.
- After going through the exit at (F-8), you will once again be above
  ground. Head to (E-10) to get to the upper level. You will pass The
  Mute and The Afflictor again on your way to (E-10). On the upper
  level, go to (G-10) on the large \"island\", where you will find Ge'Fhu
  Yagudoeye. Upon talking to Ge'Fhu Yagudoeye, four Quadav notorious
  monsters will spawn. Two of them are Nickel Quadavs, which are
  Paladins. The other two are Magnes Quadavs, which are Black Mages.
  This fight can done solo easily by a level 75.
- After the fight, talk to Ge'Fhu Yagudoeye again, and you'll receive a
  short cutscene. Head back to Oldton Movalpolos and speak with Koblakiq
  to complete the quest and receive your Jaguar Mantle as a reward.

  September 2007.[1]
  - A Moogle was put in his spot, who would inform adventurers that
    Varchet fell into financial ruin or had the flu or something and
    couldn't gamble.

    could be manipulated by 3rd-party tools, causing an infinite gil

    few weeks later.[2]

Completion of this quest requires you to have access to one of two
zones; Phomiuna Aqueducts, or Sacrarium. Each require different progress
within the Chains of Promathia missions to enter (see the proper zones
page for info). The goal to finish in either case is to check a ???
target on a bookshelf to find the key item Tavnazian cookbook.

- Phomiuna Aqueducts Walkthrough:
  - The bookshelves in Phomiuna Aqueducts are located in the four rooms
    of (F-7), (F-9), (J-7), (J-9) on the third map.
  - From the entrance, navigate to one of the two iron doors at either
    (G-8), or (J-6). You will need a Bronze Key item, or a Thief with
    proper tools, to pick the lock and open the iron door. Be cautious
    of the Taurus nearby and navigate past the iron door to the ladder
    at (E-8) or (M-8).
  - At this point there are 2 true-sight taurus enemies in either
    hallway leading to the libraries. Deal with them as you see fit, but
    please note there is no way to avoid their aggro in the narrow
    corridors. The library where the ??? targets for the Tavnazian
    cookbook are just beyond.
  - The ??? target for the Tavnazian cookbook can appear on one of two
    bookshelves within a library. Either the north or south one.
  - ??? targets move to the next room in the pattern approximately every
    10 minutes earth time.
  - Once you've found the ??? check it for the key item, Tavnazian
    cookbook.
  - Return to Jonette in Tavnavian Safehold, and speak to her. She will
    take the cookbook, award you with a Page from Miratete's Memoirs and
    the quest is completed.

- Sacrarium Walkthrough:
  - The bookshelves in Sacrarium are located in the outer rooms
    surrounding the maze. The ??? targets only appear within the four
    corner rooms. Passing through the maze is required to reach them.
  - You will need a form of sneak to travel safely. Invisible is not
    needed at all. The zone has multiple truesight aggressive Stegotaur
    enemies positioned at key areas that require attention to pass by
    safely.
  - From the entrance, take one of the two paths into the maze that is
    accessible according to the day. There is always one Stegotaur which
    can spawn in either hall's maze entrance. If it's blocking the
    opened path to the maze, one way to pass by is try to avoid it when
    it turns away. Another way would be to aggro it, zone, then pass its
    area before it can respawn.
  - Navigate through the maze to the north or south corridors of
    Sacrarium.
  - The ??? target will be in one of the four corner rooms at
    (F-5),(H-5), (F-11), or (H-11). They are located on the inner sides
    of bookshelves facing away from the door.
  - The ??? target moves to the next room every 10 minutes earth time.
  - The pattern the ??? target changes rooms is: Northeast > Northwest >
    Southeast > Southwest.
  - Once you've found the ??? check it for the key item, Tavnazian
    cookbook.
  - Return to Jonette in Tavnavian Safehold, and speak to her. She will
    take the cookbook, award you with a Page from Miratete's Memoirs and
    the quest is completed.

- Repeating the Quest: The quest can be repeated once every conquest
  week. Restart the quest by simply speaking to Jonette the next
  conquest week.

Note: If you do not return to Jonette to receive the Page from
Miratete's Memoirs before the current conquest week ends, you will not
be able to repeat the quest the next week.

Talk to Rouva on the West side of Victory Square (I-8) to begin the

- The Rivernewort key item can be found at a ??? located in either
  Riverne - Site #B01 or Riverne - Site #A01. To get to either you will
  require Giant Scale(s), or the Home Point Warps, to teleport through
  the Unstable Displacements.
  - Riverne - Site #A01: The ??? is found on the island at (E-8)
    containing the zone to Monarch Linn. Two Giant Scales are required.
    (The Home Point warp places you at (I-9)).
  - Riverne - Site #B01: The ??? is found on the island at (E-7), just
    before the final Stable Displacement heading towards Monarch Linn
    island. One Giant Scale, or the Home Point warp, is required.
- Once you have acquired the Rivernewort, return to Rouva for your
  reward; a Page from Miratete's Memoirs.

  The Eldieme Necropolis and to visit the tomb of a a great bard of
  yesteryear. Once there you are to purify the tomb and play the
  requiem. She returns the flask of holy water and sends you on your
  way.
  - (Optional) Speak to Malatigeat at the meadhouse for more information
    on this 'great bard of yesteryear'.

From this point on, the quest can be completed on any job.

- Travel to The Eldieme Necropolis via (F-5) in Batallia Downs and head
  for a room with five unbroken sarcophagi at D-4.
  - You will have to travel through Beaucedine Glacier to reach the
    barrow containing the proper entrance to the Necropolis complex.
  - If you have unlocked the Lycopodium (NPC) teleport service for
    Batallia Downs, trading one of the accepted flowers to the sparkling
    light (blank target) at (F-5) teleports the player to the elevated
    portion of the map.
  - The quickest way is to take the Voidwatch warp to Beaucedine
    Glacier.
    - Unity Warp will take you near it.
- Trade the flask of Holy Water to the sarcophagus to spawn three
  skeleton NMs. The sarcophagus that will spawn the NMs is random.
  - Side with three, one closest to the exit door
- Defeat all three NMs that spawn interact with the same sarcophagus
  again. You will get a cutscene and receive the Star ring (tarnished).
  - If you have multiple people doing this quest, they can trade their
    holy water to the correct sarcophagus after the fight and they will
    get the cutscene and ring.
- Return to Bki Tbujhja and receive your Choral Slippers.

Field Notes

The three NM skeletons that spawn are as follows:

- Yum Kimil (BLM)
- Dog Guardian
- Owl Guardian

The two Guardian skeletons are roughly lvl 50-55, where as Yum Kimil is
likely 60-65. They are all highly resistant to Lullaby, even with a 75
Bard. A standard geared White Mage at 75 was able to Repose the
Guardians without any trouble at all for the full sleep duration. Two
level 75 characters should have little difficulty defeating the NMs.
You do not need to be on Bard to activate the NMs or receive the
cutscene.

Notes

- You must have CoP 4-3 flagged for Sacrarium access. It is unknown if
  it is possible to flag this quest before you flag 4-3.

- It's possible to not be able to flag this mission even with 4-3 active
  and having gotten the first cut-scene of 4-3 via the Walnut Door on
  the Second Floor

  - Test whether this quest can be flagged after entering the Sacrarium
    for the first time.

- This quest would appear in \"Other Areas,\" as quests like A Hard Day's
  Knight appear there.

  { title = "Fame", walkthrough = [[Certain areas have fame that raises based on quests that you do
elsewhere.
Jeuno fame is a combination of your fame from Bastok, San d'Oria and
Windurst, and can also be raised directly by doing quests in Jeuno. You
may find your fame to be elevated in Jeuno before you've even attempted
a single quest in the area.
Norg fame is raised through doing quests from Norg as well as quests for
the Tenshodo. It can also be raised through various quests offered in
individual nations.

There are other areas which have fame which are directly linked to
various nations.

- Selbina quests increase fame in both Bastok and San d'Oria.
- Mhaura quests will increase fame in Windurst.
- Kazham quests will increase fame in Windurst, and Windurst quests will
  directly increase Kazham fame.

Basically, fame can be broken down by areas which are directly related
to nations:

- Selbina is linked directly with Bastok and San d'Oria.
- Mhaura and Kazham are directly linked with Windurst.
- Norg fame is derived from quests specific to the Tenshodo and Norg
  itself. Each of the three nations and Jeuno all have ways of
  increasing fame in Norg.
- Jeuno fame is derived from a combination of your fame from all three
  home nations, as well as quests from Jeuno.
- Adoulin fame is derived from many available Adoulin Quests.

There are numerous quests for increasing fame, many of which can be
repeated for rapid increase of fame. Most notably is Norg fame, for
Utsusemi: Ichi, where people will repeat simple trade quests in both
Bastok and Windurst. Quests offer varying amounts of fame; shorter and
easier quests will grant smaller amounts of fame, whereas longer and
harder quests typically offer more. AF quests are notable for their
rapid increase in fame for the nation where they are offered.

Fame may also be known as Reputation. This is a term carried over from
various other MMOs, and is occasionally used by SE. Reputation is a less
common term.

Abyssea areas each have their own fame levels, and are not linked
between each other. It generally takes five quest completions to raise
in fame for each level, with a maximum level of 6. This means you need
to complete roughly 25 quests to hit maximum fame. It does not seem like
a lot, but a rule of thumb is you must zone between each completion
adding a large amount of extra time to this task.

It is also worth noting that Dominion Ops do not raise your fame level
regardless of the amount completed.

Neptune's Spire Inn.

Quickest Claim To Fame

For a new player (or a returning player who wants to fulfill some max
fame requirements), these are some easy and repeatable quests that will
max your fame in all original nations. The amounts listed as the
requirement to max your fame is based off the assumption you have no
fame in that nation (or Level 1 fame).
* Jeuno: Your Jeuno fame is comprised of Jeuno quests and some
accumulated combination of your fame in San d'Oria, Bastok, and
Windurst. Between maxing your fame in the other nations, and completing
some of the \"must do\" Jeuno quests (like Chocobo quest), your fame in
Jeuno will max out on its own and not generally require you to do many
of the other quests in that region.

- / San d'Oria, Bastok, Selbina, Rabao, and Jeuno: Only The Best

:*Millioncorn route as those are cheap, readily available and only take
about 24 stacks.

- Windurst and Kazham: Mandragora Mad

:*Go the Cornette route, they are readily available for either 50 Sparks
or from Harmodios in Bastok Markets - (K-10) at 224 Gil when Bastok is
at least 2nd place in Conquest, if 3rd place this shop won't stock them.

::*It will take around 55 Cornettes to max fame in this region.

- Norg/Tenshodo: Shady Business

:*Zinc Ore are readily available for 200 gil each from Teerth in Bastok
Markets - (H-8).

::* You can buy the Zinc Ore in stacks of x12 from Teerth.

::*It will take 80 zinc ores (20 turn-ins) to max your fame. Purchase 81
total zinc ores if you have not completed the previous quest Beauty and
the Galka.

- Abyssea: Each Abyssea zone has its own fame level, and its own fame
  NPCs.
  - There is a \"quick fame\" quest in each zone that is repeatable. These
    are denoted with a \"\" mark on the Abyssea Quests page.

- Adoulin: Your fame is comprised of many available Adoulin Quests.
  Doing various quests seems to be the only way to improve fame.

:*Certain quests such as A Shot in the Dark, Cafe...teria, It Sets My
Heart Aflutter, and A Good Pair of Crocs (Aflutter must be repeated
first) are easily repeatable once a conquest tally.

::*It will take about 35 turn-ins for each quest to max fame from 0.
(105 total quest completions.)

::*Coalitions do not appear to affect fame.

  Three Mage Gate.
  - Alternately, if you possess a Rhinostery certificate, you can enter
    Toraimarai Canal to get to this section of Inner Horutoto Ruins.
  - The quickest way to finish this cutscene, is to use the Toraimarai
    Canal Survival Guide teleport. It places you right outside of the

Ranking up to Captain

Unlike the other ranks, the Captain Promotion does not rely upon rank-up
points. Instead, this quest is offered once a mercenary has successfully
completed all 50 main assaults and all of the Treasures of Aht Urhgan
Missions. Players initially enter their mercenary company at Private
Second Class, and through successful completion of assault missions can
rise as high as Captain.

Having the Captain rank confers certain benefits:

- Rytaal will reserve a 4th tag.
  - This happens without the Promotion: Captain quest being started or
    completed. Immediately after finishing the 50th assault and then
    speaking to Rytaal he will speak of the new ID.
- Runic Portal permits cost 0 Imperial Standing.
- Access to Alzadaal Undersea Ruins no longer costs a 1 Imperial Silver
  Piece fee.

- The ability to begin building a Mythic Weapon.

- Speak to Maat on a level 50 job. He will ask you for three items that
  drop from dungeons around Jeuno.
- You may either defeat monsters in order to obtain the required items
  or select three ???s on the ground in the zones to obtain the key
  items instead. Three key items will combine into the required item.
  - If you are attempting this solo you will need the various forms of
    Sneak and Invisible:
    - Sneak and Invisible spells.
    - Silent Oil and Prism Powders items.
    - Spectral Jig ability.
    - Tonko: Ichi and Monomi: Ichi Ninjutsu.
  - You will need to cancel invisible (not sneak) when the coast is
    clear in order to select the ??? and then reapply each time.
    Bringing some form of Reraise such as a Scroll of Instant Reraise is
    recommended.
- If you wish to fight the monsters for the drop as opposed to
  collecting key items, Trusts will be sufficient for this purpose. Be
  wary of Explosure's Self-Destruct and Exoray's conal Breath damage
  attacks. Trusts such as Cipher: Zeid will attempt to Stun such
  dangerous TP moves.

Maps are located below.

If at any point you possess one of the three items in any of your
inventories, clicking a ??? in that zone will result in the prompt
\"There is nothing out of the ordinary here.\", regardless of how many
other key items of that type which you have already collected.

The required items may be obtained in any order and are as follows:

- [] Bomb Coal which drops from Explosures or can be received after
  obtaining three Bomb coal fragments from ??? targets in Garlaige
  Citadel.
  - All three ??? pieces may be obtained on Map 2 in Garlaige Citadel at
    (G-6), (H-7), and (I-8). Avoid falling in any holes in the floor on
    the way there.
  - Use a Pouch of weighted stones (key item) to get past the first
    Banishing Gate up ahead soon.
    - Obtained at (G-8) (Map 1) south of where you first enter, click
      the ??? on the floor and it is yours.
      - Be careful as undead aggro low HP through sneak and invisible.
  - Proceed south and east until you reach the first Banishing Gate, and
    proceed through it.
  - You will enter a square room, run along the outside to the east.
    There is only one real way to go.
  - Once you reach and head down the stairs hug the left wall until you
    eventually reach a wide room.
    - The First ??? is here at (I-8).
  - Head north west to a second room where the second ??? is at (H-7)
  - Continue north, and eventually make a left down a hallway.
  - The last ??? will be at (G-6) on your right in the first room after
    running past the third Banishing Gate.

- [] Exoray Mold which drops from Exorays () or can be received after
  obtaining three Exoray mold crumbs from ??? targets in Crawler's Nest
  - The first ??? may be found on the path from (I-10) on Map 1 heading
    towards map 3 (B). Use Sneak to avoid Exorays.
    - Enter the zone, run past the crawlers and bees, run up the hill,
      and drop down into the \"sack room\" then head south west/south. It
      is not the dead end room directly south.
  - The second ??? is at (I-6) on Map 3 further along the same path.
  - The last ??? piece is located in the Exorays on Map 2 at (G-10).
    - Double back past the first two ???s to the \"sack room\" again and
      take the north west tunnel. Not the dead end room with scorpions.
    - Run forward through the green glow and up the hill to drop into a
      new sack room and take the left (west by south west) tunnel.
    - Take a right at the ledge (don't fall down) and then your next
      left into a dead end room with the ???.

- [] Ancient Papyrus which drops from Liches () or can be received after
  obtaining three Ancient papyrus shreds from ??? targets in The Eldieme
  Necropolis
  - Zone in to The Eldieme Necropolis from (I/J-10) in Batallia Downs.
  - The three ???s are located at (F-7), (F-9), and (H-9) on Map 1.
  - Run in and make a left where the road forks past the ghosts and
    follow the hallway.
  - When the road forks at the Hellhounds, if the path to the leftis
    open and you see Liches around a Brazier (flame) then proceed that
    way the first ??? will be in the left corner of the room.
    - If there is a wall to your left and the path is blocked, make a
      right (north) into a large room of square grave looking things.
      - Do not walk over these graves throughout the zone as you may
        fall through them to a lower level. If this happens warp and
        reenter the zone.
    - Make a left towards the Gravestone and behind will be the the East
      Plate. Select it and it will fall down, the path is now open so
      double back and obtain your first ??? in the room with the Liches
      and Brazier.
      - Alternatively if you posses a Magicked astrolabe, purchased for
        10,000 gil from Churano-Shurano in Windurst Waters at (F-8) you
        may just open the gate by yourself.
        - You will no longer need to use this or any plate to change the
          doors again.
        - Be careful as the bomb by the plate lever thing is aggressive
          to magic.
  - Proceed through this first room of Liches/Fallen Knights around a
    Brazier and your first ??? to then reach an identical one down the
    hallway where your second ??? is located in the corner of the room.
  - Continuing following the path west from there (the only way you can
    still go) and round the corner (north) into a large room of square
    graves and ghosts/fomors.
    - Once again do not walk over any of these graves as some are a
      hidden drop down hole.
  - Proceed north through this room and up the stairs on the other side.
  - Round the corner again and you will reach another room of Liches and
    a Brazier; the final ??? will be in the corner of the room once
    more.

- Trade to Maat the items to complete the quest.

Note: Either you or a player assisting you must possess a Crimson orb
from a mini-quest below.

- To obtain the Orcish crest, head to Davoi and enter the Monastic
  Cavern at (H-11).
- Exit the Monastic Cavern at (I-8).
- Proceed to the (J-9) entrance to Monastic Cavern. You or a partner
  will need a Crimson orb from Sedal-Godjal to access it though.
  - Once inside Monastic Cavern, click the ??? at (J-6) to get the
    Orcish Crest.
  - Take care as orcs around this wall will aggro you after dropping
    invisible and interrupt the prompt to open the wall.

Obtaining the Crimson Orb

- After following the path mentioned above up to the J-9 entrance, speak
  to Sedal-Godjal in Davoi at (J-8) just north of the (J-9) Wall of
  Banishing.
- Proceed to and touch the Wall of Banishing to the south at (J-9), then
  return to him to get the White orb.
- From there head to and touch the ponds at (H-10), (L-9), (E-8) and
  (H-6).
  - After each pond, the orb will turn into a darker orb color: Pink
    orb > Red orb > Blood orb.
  - Touching the 4th will grant the Cursed orb, and you will have Curse
    inflicted on you. This can be removed through normal means like Holy
    Water or Cursna.
- Return to Sedal-Godjal to get the final Crimson orb.

- After obtaining the Crimson orb, return to the Wall of Banishing you
  were previously at in Davoi, (J-9).
- Once inside Monastic Cavern, to get to the ??? at (J-6), stick to the
  west wall to avoid true-sight Notorious Monsters.
  - The Crest is in some weird cave-flower-looking stalks before the
    cliff. Do not fall down the cliff.

Note: Either you or a player assisting you must possess the Silver bell,
Coruscant rosary, and Black matinee necklace from the mission Magicite
before you may get this crest.
Note: It is also recommended to bring some form of Sneak for this;
Invisible is not needed. Silent Oils from the Curio Moogle are
preferred, as you should use The Mute to silence yourself before running
through Beadeaux. This prevents The Afflictor from cursing you which
inflicts a super gravity effect on you.

- To obtain the Quadav crest, proceed to Beadeaux (K-6) and enter the
  tunnel.
  - To the eastern half of the map, first go to the tunnel starting at
    (H-7) (marked \"A\") to go to map 2.
  - Get muted by The Mute at (G-7) so you can pass by The Afflictor
    safely at (G-8) and others back on map 1. This will make you
    silenced for approximately 10 minutes, so have Silent Oil as needed
    to stay safely sneak'ed as mentioned above.
  - Proceed to (F-8) (marked \"B\") to return to map 1.
  - Go to the ramp to the second level at (E-10), and navigate to (I-9).
  - Now make your way to K-6. You don't need to go through the trenches;
    you can drop from the second level to the first.
- Follow the path to (M-8) and enter Qulun Dome.
- You are almost there, proceed through the door to the right after
  zoning. This requires the key items mentioned above.
- One true-sound NM, Ruby Quadav, guards the first room. You should be
  fine to run past if it is on the far side of the room. Otherwise this
  NM is level 71-73 and will likely stomp you or take a long time with a
  party of trusts, so just zone instead.
- Once inside the main room, hug the south wall to avoid several other
  true-sound NMs to reach the ??? spot and obtain the crest. Do not drop
  off the ledge.

Note: The Yagudo Crest is located on the 4th floor of Castle Oztroja at
H-6.
Note: Lower level players may want to bring and use a Reraise item such
as an [] Instant Reraise.
Note: Either you or a player assisting you must possess the Yagudo torch
to progress.

- To obtain the Yagudo crest, find the 3 passwords throughout the zone
  and open the 3 password trap door on the fourth floor.
  - The passwords reset when the game day changes so you may want to
    time your journey accordingly.
  - On the climb you will find 3 of the passwords. You may guess any one
    of them from the list below.
- It may be considerably quicker to brute force the Brass Statue's
  passwords instead of attempting to gather all three passwords before
  the rollover of the next Vana'diel day.

Floor 1

- Password #1 is near the entrance in the room at (H-9).
- Proceed to the Brass Door at (I-8):
  - Pull one of the levers and run back. There is a 50% chance you will
    trigger a trap door, but you may run away after hitting the handle
    and not fall.
  - Simply use the other handle after the floor raises back up if need
    be otherwise proceed.
- Follow the stairs, at (J-8) you reach the next floor, Map 2.

Floor 2

- To get the 2nd password, take a right at the first intersection on map
  2 and run west to (G-7) to reach map 6.
- Head north to reach map 7 the password is at (H-9).
- Go back to the first intersection on map 2
- Head south to the fork in the path at (H-10) then make a left.
  - There is a hidden door at the Eastern Wall at (I-10). Behind you
    will find the pattern of levers needed for opening the upcoming
    Brass Door on this floor.
- Follow the path to to the password #3 in the room at the north west
  corner of (I-8)
- Head to the Brass Door at (G-8)
  - Play with the levers there in different combinations (you may have
    already seen the correct combination in (I-10)) until the door
    opens.
  - After this door, monsters will now be more challenging to low level
    players and then dangerous by the fourth floor.
- Follow the path to (G-9) and on to the next floor, Map 3.

Floor 3

- Follow the one way path of this floor, up the stairs to (H-11), and on
  to the last floor.
  - The leeches in the pool will aggro sound if you are only running
    with invisible for the Yagudos. Don't run through the pool.

Floor 4

- Once you reach this floor you must open the Brass Door at (H-7) by
  selecting and lighting one of the torches in the corner rooms at
  (G-7), (G-8), (H-7), or (H-8).
  - You will likely want Reraise on for this if you are lower level as
    you will need to run to the Brass Door before it closes.
  - A Thief may simply use Hide to deaggro the Yagudos.
  - Once inside you may safely raise back up if need be.

- You must input the 3 passwords you collected into the pedestal (Brass
  Statue). If you want to try guessing the passwords then you may guess
  from the below list.
  - If using Trusts: it's recommended you release all of them before
    attempting the passwords. Due to physical positioning, it's possible
    your Trusts will not fall through the floor, resulting in you being
    alone and unable to release them.
    - In such a situation, you'll need to log out and back in, or type
      /returntrust all
  - The 3 passwords can be entered in any order.
  - You have to use Proper Capitalization and re-enter the menu from the
    beginning each time you fail at guessing.
  - When guessing, the system will tell you immediately when you enter
    an incorrect password.

    

- When you get the password right you will drop down and see a courtyard
  to the North, the ??? spot is on the first platform.
- Two true-sight NMs named Yagudo High Priest are in this courtyard. The
  relevant one for right now usually stands almost exactly on top of the
  ??? spot.
  - Either be patient and wait for it to move, or deliberately aggro it
    and have a Trust tank hold it while you click the ??? and Warp
    afterwards.

Turn in the quest

- Return to Jeuno and speak to Maat once you have all three key items.

- Speak to Maat on a level 61+ job. He will give you four clues and
  wishes for you to trade a Kindred's Seal to the people described in
  the clues. You are not provided with the Kindred's Seals and will need
  to procure them in order to complete this quest.

- Check your storage Satchel, Sack, or Case (the command
  /itemsearch \"Kindred's seal\" can help), and/or with Port Jeuno NPCs
  Shemo and Shami (Menu –> Status –> Currencies –> Kindred's Seals
  Stored), as you may already have enough seals. Not to be confused with
  Kindred's Crest which drops on level 70+ mobs.

- A reminder that Kindred's seals can be acquired from:
  - Any normal mob level 50-69 that checks as Easy Prey or higher.
  - Exchanged 3:1 (or 2:1 during certain campaigns) for other seal types
    from Shemo.
  - The Greeter Moogles for 10 points each, if redemption for a login
    points campaign is currently active.
    - Note that you'll need 5 seals more for New Worlds Await, so you
      may wish to acquire them at the same time – which together would
      be 9 total for 90 points.

- In return for a Seal, you will receive either a Smiling stone,
  Scowling stone, Somber stone, or Spirited stone.
  - Three clues will refer to someone in one person each in San d'Oria,
    Bastok, and Windurst.
  - The final clue will refer to someone in either Selbina or Mhaura.
  - The above are in no particular order, but all four locations are
    guaranteed.
- Speak to Maat once you have all four stones to complete the quest.

- Once you trade the testimony to Maat, he will ask if you are ready.

:*If you say yes, he will teleport you to an BCNM arena. Trade the
Testimony to Burning Circle to enter a one-on-one battle against Maat.

:* Testimonies may be used up to three times before they tear and are
unusable. You must then obtain a new testimony to attempt the fight
again.

- If you are rematching Maat on a job that is not your first, keep in
  mind that each job has an 'assigned' BCNM location, and you will be
  unable to enter the fight by trading the testimony to a Burning Circle
  other than your 'assigned' one.

:* The assigned locations are as follows:

:*Balga's Dais - MNK/WHM/SMN

  Maat, he will begin to use Asuran Fists. This tends to hurt much more

  therefore you will lose all buffs (except for food) and TP.

Monk, and can use all Hand-to-Hand weapon skills.

  Trust Magic to aid you.

around level 55+.

- To win, you must either get Maat's HP close to 0 or satisfy a special
  condition for certain jobs.

:*Special secondary win conditions include only the following jobs:

::*White Mage may instead pull Maat then stay alive for 5 min, causing
Maat to give up.

::*Thief may try to steal a Scroll of Instant Warp from Maat. Once you
steal the item, Maat will give up.

:::*Note: If you possess one already, you will not be able to steal
another.

  Scroll of Instant Warp.

Note: You keep your testimony after the fight. If you have not yet
gained access to Aht Urhgan Whitegate via the quest The Road to Aht

  What is destiny? Destiny is something that...                                                                                                                                             Is immutable.                   One forges for oneself.                    Is unknowable.
  Does the accomplishment of a goal require sacrifice and hardship? Do goals require sacrifice?                                                                                             Not if you think hard enough.   Occasionally.                              Absolutely.
  You hold in your hands a forbidden scroll. Reading it will bring you untold wisdom, but cost all that you own. Do you...                                                                  Read the scroll?                Throw the scroll away?                     Burn the scroll?
  If the loss of one life would save ten thousand, would you offer yourself without hesitation?                                                                                             Offer yourself?                 Offer another... I have no such courage.   Without hesitation.
  Would you choose a tumultuous life where fame or fortune were attainable, or a tranquil life where both were forever beyond your reach? Which do you choose?                              A chaotic life.                 A tranquil life.                           A mix of both.
  You stand on the precipice between life and death. Would you choose to live life as a beast if it would save you from falling into the shadowy abyss of the underworld? What do you do?   If it keeps me from dying...    Fall, and keep my humanity.                Embrace life as a beast.
  A companion in battle turns against you, raising a weapon to attack. Do you...                                                                                                            Brace for the blow?             Try to reason with him?                    Cut him down?
  A loved one is afflicted with a terrible illness and has little time left to live. You are asked to end that life by your own hand. Do you...                                             Seek a cure?                    Leave the world together?                  Grant the request?
  You are in the midst of a fierce battle. The enemy lying at your feet was once a friend. His breath is ragged and weak. Do you...                                                         Tend to his wounds?             End his pain?                              Ignore your old friend?
  A superior to whom you owe a great debt orders you to act in a way that violates your sense of justice. Do you...                                                                         Try to remove him from power?   Carry out the order?                       Follow your sense of justice?

  you read the item entries themselves for important info!):
  - \"The treasure I would have you seek is a pinch of golden sand. It is
    said to glow with the light of the sun and be found only on a
    certain beach.\"
    - Sunsand, Valkurm Dunes (H-9)

- - \"The treasure I would have you seek is a jewel. It is said to glow
    with a bluish tint and be found near the bank of a certain river.\"
    - Un-equip your weapons in order to pick this item up.
    - Siren's Tear, North Gustaberg (J-9)

- - \"The treasure I would have you seek is a precious stone. It is said
    to be as red as blood and found in a land of geysers.\"
    - Dangruf Stone, Dangruf Wadi (I/J-5)

- Trade him the item and he will tell you to go to Aydeewa Subterrane.
  - Keep the requested item in your inventory. You won't get the next
    cutscene at the pond if you don't have the item on you.
- Enter Aydeewa Subterrane at (G-7) in Bhaflau Thickets, and proceed to
  the platform at (H-9) for a cutscene. During the cutscene, choose to
  take his hand to continue.
  - The Voidwatch warp is the fastest shortcut to this location.

- When the cutscene is over, you will be returned to Aht Urhgan
  Whitegate and be able to change to Blue Mage.

- Sunsand is the only requested item that can be purchased at the
  Auction House under Other/MISC.

Walkthrough

- Speak with Waoud at (J-10) as a Blue Mage level 50+.
- Ask for a divination by selecting \"Gaze away.\" option. He will inform
  you that \"Your fate lies beyond the gate of nobility\".
  - He will take 1,000 Gil from you like other Divinations.
    - If you continue talking to him, he will ask if you want another
      Divination. If you choose yes, he will continue to give you the
      same message and take more gil from you.
- Go to the Imperial Whitegate door at (L-8) in Aht Urhgan Whitegate,
  and check it for a cut scene.
  - You may receive the cutscene to receive the Trust: Nashmeira.
    Examine the door again if you receive it for the correct cutscene.
- The quest is now listed in your current quest log. At this point, you
  do not need to be on Blue Mage to continue the quest.
- Your next goal is to obtain two cutscenes in the Alzadaal Undersea
  Ruins. The easiest way to achieve this is to do the following:
  - Use the Runic Portal in Whitegate to go to Nyzul Isle Staging Point.
  - Use the north exit from the staging point, and step on the
    North-East teleporter on the large map that you are on (toward
    Silver Sea Remnants) at (H-8).
  - After teleporting, use the east teleporter in the next room.
  - In the next room, use the west teleporter.
  - Once you arrive at (H-9), walk towards the exit to get the first
    cutscene.
  - Turn around and then take the west teleport in the same room.
  - Walk south towards the exit to get the second cutscene (Avoid the
    Apex Cogs).

- After the above two cutscenes, it is time to progress to a battle.
  You'll need to have an Imperial Silver Piece, Remnants Permit, or
  Captain Wildcat badge, and follow the directions in the next step. You
  cannot access the area where the battle occurs via the rest of the
  ruins, only these specific entrances.
  - Either use the Home Point to Caedarva Mire, or go to Nashmau, and
    use the west exit to Caedarva Mire.
    - In Caedarva Mire, head to (E-11) and speak to Nasheefa to enter
      Alzadaal Undersea Ruins.

- Use the teleporter at (I-9) - the one to the right when entering the
  room, then examine the blank spot in the North-west corner of (G-7) to
  pop a Nepionic Soulflayer (small CS before pop).
- Defeat the Soulflayer, then examine the blank spot again for another
  small cutscene and your reward.
  - If you zone after defeating the Soulflayer without triggering the
    cutscene you must fight it again.

    you up.
  - Do not use Weapon Skills for the kill shot; those kills won't count
    towards the 100 kills.
  - The only kills that count are normal kill hits from the sword.
  - The sword has a 'memory' of how many it has slain, so you do not
    need to worry about zoning out, logging out, etc. There is also no
    time limit.

    no indicator on the sword. Or you could just go on a killing or
    farming rampage and before you know it, voila you have met the
    requirements.
  - It is best to not use Trusts, because they will \"take\" your kills
    and you will get no credit.

    similar) to help you keep track of kills. Make use of the /echo
    command to track every 10th kill.

    like Notepad++ to find the number of \"#Playername defeats\" entries

:* Costume kit items are only necessary when using the Costume kit item.

- Activate the switches in the proper order.

:*The small switch is at the Cermet Refinery (G-7). It is underneath a
shelf by the door.

:*The medium switch is at the Replica (G-8) near the Metalworks
entrance, next to NPC Quasim.

:*The large switch is at the kiln (F-8) just outside of the
Blacksmithing Guild.

- If you activate an incorrect switch, you will have to start from the
  beginning. When you attempt to activate a switch one of the following
  NPCs will appear:

+---------------+----------------------------------+
| NPC name      | Action to avoid being arrested   |
+===============+==================================+
| Gentle Tiger  | - Leave it to Luto               |

+---------------+----------------------------------+
| Salim         | Costume kit                      |

- If you do the incorrect action, either Luto or Miledo will be
  captured. If so, speak to Ferghus then to Folzen. If the same
  character gets captured twice, the quest will end.
- Once all switches have been deactivated, return to the ??? in the
  Temple of the Goddess for a cutscene and your reward.
- You can repeat this quest once per conquest tally.

- Obtain a Carbuncle's Ruby from a Leech mob.
  - Poison Leeches in Buburimu Peninsula are possibly the easiest ones
    to drop Rubies.
  - Alternatively, Bloodsuckers in Toraimarai Canal may have the highest
    drop rate. However, the area is difficult to get to for newer
    players, and there are only two spawns - at H-9 and J-9 on Map 1.
  - Successfully farmed in Qufim Island from Acrophies with only a few
    kills.
    - The rate listed by FFXIDB is about 1% without TH, and 3%+ with
      TH3+.
  - The drop rate is low, so if you're specifically looking for the ruby
    instead of having acquired it while doing something else, consider
    using THF for Treasure Hunter as the regular drop rate is very low
    (and you might get other potentially useful drops like coffer keys
    in the process), or if you haven't learned MP Drainkiss yet as BLU
    consider using that job to make the leech fights more useful.
- Go to Windurst Walls (G-3) and examine the door of the House of the
  Hero for a cutscene.
- You will be instructed to experience 7 types of weather in outdoor
  areas. It seems only zones available in or before the Rise of Zilart
  Expansion will work.
  - Note: The Carbuncle's Ruby must be in your inventory to receive the
    weather cutscene. You also can't simply idle in a zone - you must
    zone into an area while the weather is occuring to get the scene.

- To experience the weather of one of the seven colors, you must enter
  the area while the weather is active, you will receive a brief
  cutscene confirming the weather effect.
  - To know the weather of the area you are in, check the top left
    corner of where your compass (above the day/time/pos in the bottom
    left of your screen - assuming you have it toggled-on by using
    /clock )
  - The most difficult color to obtain is Red. Hot spells and heat waves
    are more frequent in the game's summer months, although random hot
    spells can pop up any time of the game year.
    - You can check the in-game month by using the /clock command
      (identical to Menu -> Current Time). Note that the command is a
      toggle that shows/hides the compass, day, time, and pos in the
      lower left of the screen, so you'll want to use it twice to get
      back into the same state your client was in.
    - Weather is the same across the zone, and sometimes identical in
      other zones nearby.
      - For example, Rabao, Western, & Eastern Altepa Desert all have
        identical weather, so checking one is the same as checking all.
        These groupings are known as \"Areas\" at a Weather Forecast NPC.
        - While you can't get the scene in Rabao due to it being a
          non-Field area, you can use Home Point #1 there as your warp
          destination to see it periodically first-hand. From here, you
          can walk outside the entrance or use the nearby survival guide
          to jump into one of the zones.
      - Weather is not necessarily the same across the region as a
        whole, see Zulkheim having 3 distinct weathers. Also, weather
        patterns aren't necessarily bound by region lines either - see
        Elshimo Uplands & Lowlands sharing their weather trends for
        Yhoator & Yuhtunga Jungles as well as Kazham.
    - It is worth noting that Red weather also tends to be more
      prevalent around midday (12:00 noon) in the relevant zone. So if
      you are having difficulty finding this weather, try in the middle
      of the day rather than checking during nighttime.
    - In addition to time of day and the season: A Firesday appears to
      make it more probable to encounter fire weather. Hence: checking
      zones on that day is advised. (Especially Eastern Altepa Desert,
      Western Altepa Desert and Valkurm Dunes)
    - The pre-Zilart field areas where fire weather & Fire Elementals
      spawn were mainly used by Japanese players who didn't have the
      expansion pack, as SMN was released as a one-off job but not
      actually part of the Zilart expansion. In the modern game, almost
      all players will have the expansion (English players have had it
      since launch), but these areas might be still useful for any
      ambitious Free Trial players who can only visit Original areas
      from the base game.
  - Scholar's Storm Spells do not count for this quest.
  - You can check the Weather Forecast for the current and next 2 game
    days.
    - Predictions for the future have mixed accuracy, but are said to be
      more accurate if double-weather is predicted.

    lose progress; simply obtain another one.
- After Rain there is often Windy weather in La Theine Plateau.

  Wadi, Davoi, & Ifrit's Cauldron that feel a bit outdoorsy all count as
  dungeons. As a general rule of thumb, if you can't use a mount there,
  it won't count.
- You can see reminder as to which zones are \"Original Areas\" or
  \"Zilart\" by looking for region-related quests in your Records of
  Eminence quest log, or by setting your Home Point & Survival Guide
  lists to \"Select by expansion\" instead of \"Select by region\".

  cutscene with Carbuncle who requests you go to La Theine Plateau.

  quest in order to begin this one.
- Speak to Erlene, The Eldieme Necropolis (S) (J-8) on Scholar. She will
  ask you to return to the previous location where you found Schultz.
  - (Optional) Speaking with her again will result in some additional
    dialogue.
  - After flagging the quest with this cutscene, you can continue
    forward through the rest of it on any job.
- Travel to the Indescript Markings in Pashhow Marshlands (S) along the
  north edge of (E-11) next to the wall for the Unaddressed sealed
  letter.
  - The Recall-Pashh telepoint and Survival Guide will take you to the
    southern end of the map, leaving you with a shorter walk West than
    using the Campaign Arbiters warp NPCs from a Shadowreign city. The
    Grauberg (S) Survival Guide isn't terribly far from it, either.
- Read the Unaddressed sealed letter by examining it in your Temporary
  Key Item menu.
- Return to Erlene and talk to her again for a cutscene and a Porting
  magic transcript.
  - (Optional) Speaking to her again will have her repeat some of the
    same information.
- Go to Grauberg (S) (E-10) and enter the cave opposite the waterfall.
  Examine the unnamed shimmering light on the ground.
  - The cave entrance is on the boundary line of E-10 and F-10. If you
    go near the waterfall, you've gone too far. The entrance to the cave
    is on dry land. Also, if you don't heed this advice and still go
    past the waterfall, you will have to go all the way back around.
  - Using the Campaign Arbiters warp NPCs from a Shadowreign city is the
    closest arrival point. The Grauberg (S) Survival Guide is a bit
    further away.
- Inspect the Indescript Marking on the wall in the same cave to enter
  the instance.
  - Only the party leader with the quest active can enter the party into
    the instance, which is held in Ruhotz Silvermines.
  - If you fail this fight, you will need to trade Erlene a Sheet of
    Vellum to receive another Porting magic transcript before
    re-entering the fight.
- Return to Erlene after clearing the battlefield for your reward.
  - (Optional) Upon speaking to Erlene after finishing this quest,
    she'll just continue to praise you for all of your work.

Battlefield

- The instance has a 30 minute time limit and up to 6 party members can
  enter.
- You may summon Trusts inside.
- The fight is against Ulbrecht, who is a level 67 Scholar with ~12,000
  HP that uses Dark Arts Stratagems.
  - Uses a Dagger and can use Wasp Sting.
  - Will use a Stratagem every minute.
  - Can cast the following spells: Aspir, Cure IV, Drain, Dispel,
    Protect III, Regen II, Shell III, Sleep, the Storm line of spells,
    and all tier III elemental nukes. Casts tier III elemental spells
    with random elements, even after giving himself a specific Storm. In
    fact, spell selection overall is very poor and he appears to just
    randomly choose one with no real logic.
  - Immune to Silence but not any other form of Enfeebling Magic,
    including Bind, Gravity, and Sleep. Like all NMs, it is believed he
    will build resistance with repeated usage.
  - At around 50% he will use Tabula Rasa and spam spells.
    - During this time, his Stratagems will not wear off upon a single
      spell cast, lasting a full minute duration.
- The battle ends once Ulbrecht's HP drops below 20%.

Notes

- Added in the March 2008 Version Update.
- Since the October 2016 Version Update, players were able to summon
  Trusts.

  unsleepable or very difficult to sleep. It is recommended to start
  quickly as both of them will be buffed if too much time is wasted. The
  Grimoire has much less HP, and is recommended to be killed first as it
  will not cast often and instead come to you and melee. It should be
  noted that it did attempt to cast Pyrohelix, although strangely enough
  Water IV only healed it's HP. Thunder 4 took down more then half of

Notes

Similar to When Wills Collide, Mercenary Camp, and The Kuftal Tour this
CS displays fellow party members, a very rare occurrence.

- It's not much of a different angle than you'd see in game.
- You can watch this CS again with the Goblin Footprint

Originally this quest required 6 players and required a level 5 or below
job, but was dropped to 2 players and a level 15 or below job with the
June 2015 Update

- This had an added effect of allowing players who did not have a level
  5 or below job to complete the quest with 2008's Level Sync
  functionality, as with the previous level cap, you could not sync due
  to the minimum level for sync being level 10.
  - While a silly idea, one could have de-leveled their character to
    level 5. However, EXP loss on death was removed in the May 2011
    update, so only new jobs could give a player access to this if they
    were leveled above 5.

- Speak to Marin and accept the quest.
- When prompted, you need to select \"I wasn't talking to you, squirt!\"

  - If you use the Survival Guide to teleport, you must re-zone in order
    to receive this cutscene.

Escort Rules

- 

- Ken engages all enemies that are in his line of sight.

- You must keep Ken alive as he battles monsters in Dangruf Wadi.

- He has reasonable survivability, but will be in danger after about 3-4
  enemies.

- Ken cannot be stopped like NPC's used in the 3 nation escort quests.

- Ken will attack an unclaimed enemy even if it has aggression on an
  outside player.

- When attacking, Ken's target will appear unclaimed, but outside people
  still cannot attack it.

- His sight distance is considerable so be aware of your position.

- When he spots a monster, he makes a beeline for it and begins
  attacking. After a monster is dead, he will then \"snap\" back onto the
  path location he was at before he drew his weapon. This almost
  certainly means he will turn around abruptly and spot you if you were
  behind him curing him. This causes him to pass normally impassable
  terrain.

- He kills lizards and worms in usually only four-five hits. His
  accuracy is horrible though. Goblins take around five of his hits, and
  crabs take about six-seven.

- One way to make this quest easier is if you have a higher level friend
  run slightly ahead of Ken and kill monsters before he attacks them.
  You will still need to be careful that he does not spot you, and it's
  possible he will need curing if he reaches a monster before your
  friend does. Once Ken starts attacking a monster, your friend cannot
  help him.

Escort Route Progression

- Ken will always follow the same path outlined in the map provided.
- As he progresses you will receive messages of him speaking that
  indicate how far along the route he currently is. Each message
  corresponds to a number and location on the map:

- 1: \"I have this funny feeling I'm being watched... Let's see if
  anybody's following me...\"
  - At this point Ken will stop and turn around. Make sure you're out of
    sight.
- 2: \"Uh-oh... I think I'm lost. I really should have brought that map
  Sis gave me...\"
  - Ken will pause for a moment before continuing.
- 3a: \"Now, where should I begin my survey...\"
  - Ken will pause, rotate 360 degrees, Say a couple \"Hmms\" then run to
    the pond in the middle of the large room.
- 3b: \"This looks like a good place... But I wonder if there is anything
  interesting further on...\"
- 4: \"A dead end... I guess I'll go back to that other place.\"
  - Ken will turn around and return the way he came. Hide behind the
    southern rock.
- 5: \"Ah, here we are. Now let's see... Depth... Temperature...\"
  - Ken will pause to take a reading at the hot spring.
- 6: \"... What was that sound...\"
  - Ken will stop and turn around. Make sure you're out of sight.
- 7: \"Have I already been here... Wait a minute... This place looks
  familiar...\"
  - As Ken reaches the first room again he will run in circles. Make
    sure you're far away from the perimeter.
- 8: \"Huh. That was easy. I don't know what Sis was all worried about.\"
  - Ken's route is finished.

- Marin will appear at the exit. Speak to her to remove the level cap
  and receive Ken's escort award.
- Return to Bastok Markets and speak to Marin again to finish the quest.

- During the correct time for your RSE pattern you must simply head to
  your correct zone and find a ??? on the ground.

    Fly (Gusgen Mines), or Aroma Leech (Ordelle's Caves).
    - The NM is level 38-40.
      - The drop is about 10% and affected by Treasure Hunter (don't
        forget certain THF trusts like Nanaa Mihgo have TH1)
      - The ??? will respawn no more than 30 minutes after spawning the
        NM.
      - The ??? locations are noted on the maps below.
      - It's best to do this while you run around getting your main RSE
        pieces, because drop rate is not 100% and it can take up to 30
        minutes before the ??? to respawn.

- To begin this quest you must have traded an Unlit Lantern to the Altar
  of Rancor and received the Rancor Flame at some point before. It helps
  to have a Rancor Flame on you.
- Once you have used a Rancor Flame, talk to Jakoh Wahcondalo in Kazham

    just need to light all 4 lamps at the Altar. You can actually solo
    this by making 4 trips back and forth between the Rancor Flame and
    the altar. The altar seems to stay lit for quite a while.

  enter the Den. Once there, the Unlit Lanterns must be traded to the
  Altar of Rancor to receive a Rancor Flame.

Note: If you complete this quest, Zilart Mission 14, will be considered
completed as well.

!!!NOTE:!!! You must flag this quest at the blank target in The Shrine
of Ru'Avitau or you WILL NOT receive credit and will have to re-aquire
another Ark Pentasphere.

Preparation

- Enter The Shrine of Ru'Avitau from the (H-9) entrance in Ru'Aun
  Gardens.
  - Survival Guide puts you on the path to it, if you have it.
  - Home Point #5 is another fast alternative.
- Head North a short distance to find a Blank Target at (G/H-11).
- Examine the Blank Target for a cutscene.
- Examine the Blank Target again for dialogue about how to obtain an Ark
  Pentasphere.
  - Divine Might now appears in your Outlands Quests log.
- You, or someone in your group, will need to obtain an Ark Pentasphere.
  - Ark Pentaspheres are created by trading 1 Illuminink and 1 Parchment
    to the Qu'Hau Spring at (H-6) in Ro'Maeve during a full moon and
    between 18:00 and 06:00 game time.
  - Illuminink drops off Cursed Puppet and Magic Flagon in Ro'Maeve.
- Trade the Ark Pentasphere to any of the Shimmering Circles in La'Loff
  Amphitheater to access the battlefield.

Battle

- This battle has a 30 minute time limit and allows for a full alliance
  of 18 people will be allowed to enter.
  - This battle was initially uncapped at level 75 and was relatively
    challenging. Level 99 players should have little to no difficulty
    completing this.
- You will need to defeat Ark Angel MR, Ark Angel TT, Ark Angel EV, Ark
  Angel HM, and Ark Angel GK in order to win.
  - Everyone should bring some form of re-raise in order to minimize
    down time.
  - The Ark Angels share alliance hate, so people should wait to
    re-raise until the entire alliance is down and the mobs are back at
    their starting position.
  - If you feel like you're about to die, try to move out of the center
    of the arena. People left in the center of the arena are often near
    impossible to raise again without getting aggro.
- If you happen to have an alliance wipe, re-raise, heal, and then
  finish off whoever remains.
- The general strategy at level 75 was to divide and conquer. Have one
  tank/kiter on each mob, while the rest of the group kills the others
  one by one.
  - Make sure someone is keeping the pets slept at all times. They can
    cause chaos if left alone for too long.
  - The Ark Angel TT should be defeated as fast as possible because he
    has access to wide selection of nasty spells.
  - Along with having a pet, the Ark Angel MR will also charm at least
    one player before she falls.
    - Fealty, light elemental resistance equipment, and magic evasion in
      general are effective at resisting this.
  - Every time the Ark Angel GK uses Meikyo Shisui, it will try to make
    a Light Skill Chain. This can be prevented if utsusemi absorbs any
    of the weaponskills.
  - When fighting the Ark Angel HM it is recommended to have as many
    people out of Mijin Gakure range as possible. This should not be a
    problem for players in 99 ilvl equipment.
    - Barfira does not reduce Mijin Gakure damage.
  - The Ark Angel EV Spirits Within is very strong and can take out
    someone in just one hit.
- Once you have finished the battle, return to the Blank Target in The
  Shrine of Ru'Avitau to choose your reward.

Re-Questing

Note: You are only allowed to re-quest this once per Conquest Tally.

- Drop your current earring. You will need to zone if you drop it in the
  same area, as the game checks your Recycle Bin as part of its
  inspection of your various inventories. The target will be
  unresponsive until you do this.
- Receive the quest at the unmarked target (G/H-11) in the main entrance
  of The Shrine of Ru'Avitau. The game will mention your old quest
  reward by name and seems to track your prior selection.
- The quest appears as a second Divine Might quest in your quest log
  with a different description.
- Obtain a Light Ore.
- If you need a new Ark Pentasphere (an already used one will no longer
  work – \"The Illuminink on the ark pentasphere has faded.\"), obtain an
  Illuminink and Parchment as well. This part can be done prior to
  accepting the actual quest.
- Trade the Light Ore to the Qu'Hau Spring in Ro'Maeve during a Full
  Moon between 18:00 and 6:00 to receive the Moonlight ore. You cannot
  do this until the new quest has been started.
  - Warning: if you need both the Moonlight ore and the Ark Pentasphere,
    you must make TWO separate trades.
  - If all three items are traded, only the Moonlight ore will be
    obtained.
  - Each individual restarting this quest must possess their own
    Moonlight ore.
- Trade the Illuminink and Parchment to the Qu'Hau Spring in Ro'Maeve
  during a Full Moon between 18:00 and 6:00 to obtain an Ark
  Pentasphere.
  - Only one alliance member needs the Ark Pentasphere to initiate the
    battle.
- Enter and complete the Divine Might battlefield at La'Loff
  Amphitheater.
- Return to the unmarked target in The Shrine of Ru'Avitau to pick up a
  new earring.

Notes

- Prior to the June 2016 Version Update, a player would have to trade
  their items for an Ark Pentasphere or Moonlight ore on a clear night
  during the full moon from midnight to 3:00 a.m. This was eased along
  with a batch of other older quest requirements.

If you wish to attempt this quest without any guidance, these are his
descriptions of the pictures he needs.

- First Picture: First, I want t' see the volcano that can be glimpsed
  from the Wajaom Woodland. I'll never forget the plumes of smoke
  billowing from its peak, even though it was a cloudy day when I saw it
  with me own eyes.
- Second & Third Picture: Next, I want t' see the \"Lovers' Rocks\" in
  Arrapago Reef. Standing in the snow and looking upon those two pillars
  standing side by side always made me think of my dear wife.
- Fourth Picture: Next, I want t' see the ruins that can be glimpsed
  from Mount Zhayolm. I still remember the sight of them bathed in the
  gentle glow of the evening sun.
- Fifth Picture: Next, I want t' see the flows of lava seeping from the
  heights of Halvung. It was quite the spectacle for a young lad
  traipsing through in the wee hours of the morning.
- Sixth Picture: Next, I want t' see the ruins in the Aydeewa
  Subterrane. The howl of the wind there seemed to speak volumes to
  me...
- Seventh Picture: Next, I want t' see the waterfall in Mamook. I was
  lost for words in its beauty, an opalescent thread reflecting the
  light of the sun.
- Eighth Picture: Next, I want t' see the graveyard in Caedarva Mire. By

  - Your goal is to find what intimidates the beastmen.
- Select which type of Beastman you are going to investigate:
  - Lamia - Caedarva Mire (I-7)
    - Fastest route is the Ilrusi Atoll staging point or Arrapago Reef
      Survival Guide and then using Escape
    - Select the nearby Peculiar Plants to make a sound
    - Melee it
  - Troll - Mount Zhayolm (L-6)

      to the L-10 exit back to Wajaom Woodlands.
    - Select the nearby Peculiar Bud to make a smell
      - This can have at least two messages. Make sure it is \"A liquid
        drips from the plant when you touch it, making your eyes blink
        rapidly.\"
    - Lead it off the nearby ledge
- Touching the ??? will spawn a NM. This NM will be intimidated
  sometimes and you have to figure out what intimidates it.
  - In addition to the two unique intimidation possibilities above, all
    three NMs share these possibilities:
    - A certain Weaponskill
    - A Weaponskill from a certain angle
    - A certain element
  - Two of the five potential factors will intimidate the NM.
    - These change regularly.
- Report your theory to Hishahma after defeating the NM.
  - You can easily test the two unique options for each monster type,
    which means you are guaranteed to get at least one of your
    selections correct.
- After zoning and waiting 1 minute, talk to Hishahma again to find out
  whether you were correct:
  - If you get one of the two things right, you will receive 200
    Imperial Standing.

  conditions for these to appear are as follows:
- 1): Defeat Cutthroat Kabsalah
- 2): Defeat Cutthroat Kabsalah after defeating Bubbly
- 3): Attack Cutthroat Kabsalah by surprising him. In order to do this,
  the following conditions must be met:
  - The Windjammer Imps must be attacked, not aggroed
  - Cutthroat Kabsalah must not hear any of the flute-based abilities of
    the Imps
  - Cutthroat Kabsalah must be pulled (preferably by spells or ranged
    attacks) without alarming Bubbly
  - If you successfully surprise the captain, he will say something
    indicating his surprise.
- The ideal strategy is to have someone kite Cutthroat Kabsalah while
  the rest of the party focuses on killing Bubbly.
- Once Bubbly is down, everyone can take out Cutthroat Kabsalah.

Notes

- What low level players should know about Incredibly Tough mobs (level
  79-92) in beginner zones such as Inner Horutoto Ruins.
  - Why they are here:
    - After the level cap was raised beyond 75 in the Abyssea era, SE
      decided to repurpose some of the many underutilized low level
      zones into leveling camps for level 75+.
  - These changes should not disrupt new players:
    - Regular wildlife (Beasts, Vermin, etc.) will be non-aggressive.
      You can walk past them.
    - Evil creatures (Undead, Beastmen, Demons will still be aggressive
      and should be avoided.
      - You do not need Sneak and Invisible usually. Check for
        alternative tunnels where these creatures are not present.
      - At Inner Horutoto Ruins, the southern tunnel marked B on the
        maps do not have skeletons or goblins.

First Envelope

- Head to Sauromugue Champaign and check the ???s in the following
  locations to attempt to spawn Climbpix Highrise. The tower that spawns
  Climbpix Highrise is random, so just check them all until he appears.
  - You will know you're checking the correct locations if you receive
    the message: It is impossible to climb this wall with your bare
    hands.
- There are 6 towers in all that are represented by dark dots on the
  Sauromugue Champaign map. Their locations are:
  - G-6
  - G/H-8
  - I/J-7
  - J/K-8
  - K-9
  - I-9/10 - Can only be reached the following ways:
    - Sauromugue Champaign's Survival Guide teleportation.
    - Voidwatch warp takes you to the correct location — the first tier
      of White Stratum Abyssite is required.
    - Use the Cavernous Maw in Sauromugue Champaign (S).
    - Go through Garlaige Citadel, passing through the third Banishing
      Gate and exiting into Sauromugue Champaign.
- Climbpix Highrise drops a Grapnel. This is needed for the next part of
  the quest.
- Next, go to the tower at I/J-7 and take off all your equipment.
- Trade your Grapnel to the ??? and watch the cutscene to get your First
  signed forged envelope.

Second Envelope

- Go to Lower Jeuno (H-10) and talk to Sniggnix (in the back hallway at
  Muckvix's Junk Shop). You have to beat him at a game of dice.
- Keep rolling against him until you beat him.
- Head to Dangruf Wadi to gamble against 3 more Goblins. You have to
  beat them all in order.
  - Each time you roll against a Goblin you have to give them their
    favorite item. Once you've rolled, win or lose, the item is gone.
  - You do not have to beat them consecutively. If you lose, trade the
    item again: there is no need to return to a previous goblin.
  - Expect to lose to each goblin at least once. See: .
    - Due to a quality of life update from 2016, the dice game
      difficulty will now be reduced after you've lost.[1]

- Here are the Goblins' locations and items:
  - First: Saltvix
    - Item: Rock Salt
    - Location: The ??? in the western part of the room at G-7
      (technically the ??? is in F-7)
  - Second: Grasswix
    - Item: Gausebit Grass
    - Location: The ??? at F-4/5 where the underground tunnel comes out
  - Third: Eggblix
    - Item: Lizard Egg
    - Location: Go to the area that spans across F-11 and G-11 and go
      all the way west. There is a hidden cave at F-11 - just walk
      through the wall. Follow the tunnel until you reach a hole in the
      floor. Drop down this hole and head south to the corner at E-12.
      This is where the ??? for the last goblin is.
- Go to these ??? in order and trade each one their respective item.
  Then roll against them. If you lose, you need to trade another of
  their favorite item.
- After winning all three games, head to J-3 in Dangruf Wadi. Ride the
  geyser up the cliff and follow the path until you zone out into North
  Gustaberg.
  - If you have unlocked the Geomagnetic Fount for North Gustaberg then
    warping back to town and using that would be faster.
- Head to the east and follow the river all the way down to the
  waterfall (stay on the south side of the river).
- You'll find a ??? click on it and spawn Gambilox Wanderling.
- After defeating the goblin, click on the ??? again to get a Regal Die
  and a cutscene.
  - If you lose and die, then if you come back soon then you may find
    that the ??? just says \"It still smells like a Goblin...\" instead of
    spawning the enemy - then you just need to wait a few minutes and
    try again.
- Head back to Lower Jeuno and trade your Regal Die to Sniggnix to get
  the Second signed forged envelope.

quest.

Walkthrough

- Speak to Nanaa Mihgo in Windurst Woods (J-3) to receive the Cat
  Burglar's note.
- Go to Lower Jeuno (G-10) and speak to Yatniel on the top floor. He
  will ask for 4x Quake Grenades.
- Trade the Quake Grenades to him for a clue.
  - NOTE: Although you can skip this part and get the Bomb incense and
    fight the Chandelier, you MUST turn in the Quake Grenades in order
    to clear the KI from Nanaa so she will allow you to complete the
    quest.
- Go to Mhaura (H-8) and speak to Hagain who is located in one of the
  upstairs rooms in the Sailor's Stay. He will give you the Bomb
  incense.
- Head to Garlaige Citadel via the main entrance.
- You will now need to examine multiple ??? in a specific order. Go to
  each one and choose \"Yes\" to use the Bomb incense.
  - NOTE: Switching to first person view and locking on to the points
    make it easier to target them.
  - Walk to I-9 near the first banishing gate for the first ???.
  - Head west a bit and look around at H-9 for another ???.
  - Go through the first Banishing Gate and follow the map down to F-9.
    The ??? to the west of the intersection is the one you want.
  - Go across the hall to the east for another ??? at F/G-9.
  - Go back the way you came, towards the Banishing Gate #1. Examine the
    ??? at G-8/9.
  - Head to the north of this area for another ??? at G-7.
  - Head east to pop the NM at the I-6 ???.
  - READ BELOW BEFORE CLICKING THIS LAST ??

- The last ??? you'll examine will spawn a Bomb named Chandelier. This
  text below is confusing so I'll simplify, all you have to do is click
  ??? and then use Hide before the boss spawns so it doesn't self
  destruct. Then kill it normally.
- If it uses Self-Destruct before being claimed then it will not drop
  the Chandelier Coal.
  - If it self-destructs before it is killed otherwise then there is a
    very minor chance it will drop.
    - When this mob is spawned, if he is not claimed before he aggros,
      he will immediately self-destruct.
    - If it spawns and sees a player character before it is claimed, he
      will immediately self-destruct.
    - If it is spawned while a player is casting magic nearby, he will
      immediately self-destruct.
- If you fail to successfully claim him and he self-destructs then you
  will have to wait 10 minutes for the ??? to respawn.
  - You do not have to go back and check all the ??? again.
  - You DO have to go back and check all of the ??? again IF you leave
    the zone.
- Spectral Jig immediately after the cutscene is a great way to avoid
  detection. Hide works as well.

Afterwards

- Go back to Mhaura and trade the Chandelier Coal to Hagain.
- Head to Windurst Woods and talk to Nanaa Mihgo.
- Go to Ordelle's Caves. Enter the cave in La Theine Plateau at F-7.
  Bring a Pickaxe
- NOTE: If you have the Proto-Waypoint in La Theine Plateau, you can
  warp to the valley and skip the below Ordelle's Caves. However, make
  sure you zone into Ordelle's Caves and then back out again before
  continuing or you can't trade the pickaxe.
  - Follow the maps around to the hole at H-11/12 (located on the same
    map you were on when you first entered, just at another section).
    - Drop down this hole and head to the tunnel to the east (I-11), be
      careful not to fall off the cliff.
  - Follow the stairs to the first intersection (I-6), take a left
    (south) and keep going. Take the tunnel to the right that heads west
    (H-9) and take it (you know you're on the right track if you see
    Napalm mobs).
  - You'll zone back into La Theine Plateau.
- Head to the middle of the valley until you find a ??? at the
  south-west corner of H-10. Trade your Pickaxe to the ??? for a cut
  scene and your reward.
  - Other Pickaxe varieties will not work.

- The cutscene that follows the next fight is known to cause problems
  for Windower addons. It may freeze. If it does:
  - If you use FastCS simply unload it when the cutscene stops and it
    should proceed - you can immediately reload it and the cutscene
    should proceed without issue.
  - If you use Enternity and the cutscene stalls, it may be due to the
    animation needing to catch up with the chat log. Just give it more
    time for the animation to catch up with the chat log.
  - If all else fails simply reload using basic pol.exe and the cutscene
    should replay and complete successfully.
  - 5/6/22 using all of the above I only had to reload FastCS when the
    cutscene paused. It then completed without a problem.

- Speak with Ripapa to obtain the quest. If you are positive that you
  have the required fame but she is not allowing you to undertake this
  quest, continue speaking with her until her text changes. Once you
  have received the key item: Tuning fork of lightning, you can now
  safely undertake the quest.
- Travel to The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah enter to The Boyahda Tree at (K-12)
  or (J-12). On the first map of The Boyahda Tree, travel to (A-7) to
  climb to the second map. On the second map, go behind the waterfall at
  (I-11) to find the hidden entrance to the Cloister of Storms.
  - Preferably, home point to The Boyahda Tree #1. If you don't have it
    yet, make sure to grab it on the way.
  - The Unity 135 warp will put you on map B so the home point is a
    short run away. Beware of aggro from mobs even at level 99.
- Defeat Ramuh Prime and you will receive a key item: Whisper of storms
- Return to Ripapa with the whisper and she will provide several reward
  options including the ability to summon Ramuh.

Notes

- Up to 6 party members can enter the arena.
- Each party member must have their own Tuning fork of lightning.
- Time limit is 30 minutes.
- You can only select one of the rewards Ripapa offers at any time.
- You may repeat this quest once per Earth day.
- You can save yourself a lot of time traveling to the Cloister by using
  the Mini Fork of Ltn. given by the quest Trial-Size Trial by
  Lightning. You must be on Summoner as your main job, and obtain the
  Mini Tuning Fork from Lacia, trade the fork back to Lacia, but enter
  the Protocrystal normally. So long as you do not clear the level 20
  version of the BC, you may warp to the Cloister as many times as you
  wish.
- You may also choose to retain the whisper in order to complete the
  requirements for this quest: The Moonlit Path.

- Have 30 fishing skill or greater, including temporary boosts from
  either gear or image support, and talk to Zaldon.
  - The latent effect of Trainee's spectacles has also been confirmed to
    count toward the 30 skill requirement.
  - Once you've flagged the quest by talking to Zaldon with adequate
    fishing skill and The Real Gift completed, you will be able to
    complete the quest for the first time even if you're under 30, as
    well as for subsequent turn-ins.
  - Zaldon will change his dialogue dynamically whether or not you have
    30+ skill (telling you to talk to Gabwaleid if you have 29 or
    lower), but will still accept fish as long as you've flagged the
    quest.
- Trade Zaldon certain fish and he will gut them for you.
- He will buy the fish that you trade for a fixed price, as well as give
  you anything that might be in its stomach.
- As of the November 10th, 2021 Version Update, the chance to receive an
  item is increased when a bigger fish is traded. Fish size is noted on
  each fish when looking at it in your inventory.

  meet the fishing level requirement to repeat the quest.

You must first have obtained the 6 summonable Celestial avatars (and
possibly Fenrir) before you are presented with the Rainbow resonator.

- Speak to Carbuncle at the ??? (G-6) in La Theine Plateau.
- You must collect six key items dropped from six battles against much
  harder versions of the 6 Celestial avatars.
  - These battlefields are not the same \"Trial by...\" battlefields,
    therefore you do not need to activate the quests.
- Each battle takes place at the avatar's respective Cloister. Enter
  this quest's battlefield by selecting \"Waking the Beast\" at the BCNM
  entrances.
  - The battlefields allow for up to 18 players to enter at once.
  - Trust Magic is not usable in these battlefields.
  - The avatars are level 85 and have access to their meritable Blood
    Pacts.
  - The avatars are able to use their Astral Flow move at any time.
  - Each Avatar is supported by four elementals who share hate with the
    avatar.
    - The elementals can cure the avatar by casting a tier IV elemental
      nukes on it.
    - The elementals will not respawn unless the avatar uses their
      meritable Blood Pact, spawning one with a maximum of four at a
      time.
      - If the target of the Blood Pact dies to the Blood Pact, an
        elemental will not spawn.
    - Each of the elemental's melee attacks have the added effect of the
      corresponding debuff.
  - Defeating each avatar will award you with the appropriate key item.
- Once you have obtained all six key items, proceed to Full Moon
  Fountain for a cutscene and the last Battle.
  - HP Warp Toraimarai Canal is the fastest way there
  - Up to 18 players are allowed to enter this battlefield at once.
  - The battle will begin against Carbuncle.
  - Once Carbuncle's health reaches 75%, he will disappear and will be
    replaced by one of the 6 summonable Celestial Avatars.
  - After that avatar is defeated, Carbuncle will re-appear with 75%
    health.
  - Once Carbuncle's health reaches 50%, he will disappear and will be
    replaced by two of the remaining 6 summonable Celestial Avatars.
  - After the next two avatars are defeated, Carbuncle will re-appear
    with 50% health.
  - When Carbuncle's health reaches 25%, he will disappear once again
    and be replaced by the remaining 3 summonable Celestial Avatars.
  - Once the three avatars are defeated, five Carbuncle Primes will
    spawn at once.
    - Each will use Searing Light before it is defeated.
    - Each can use Searing Light multiple times.
  - Defeat all five Carbuncle Primes to win the battle.
- The six key items are not lost upon defeat, but lost upon winning the
  fight.
- During the cutscene you are given a choice to return the Faded ruby to
  Carbuncle. Your choice determines the title given to you when the
  quest is complete.
- Return to the ??? (G-6) in La Theine Plateau. Your title will be
  determined at this time:
  - If you chose to return the ruby, you will receive the title of
    \"Disturber of Slumber\".
  - If you chose not to return the ruby, you will receive the title of
    \"Interrupter of Dreams\".

- Every player who participates in the final fight will receive a
  Carbuncle's Pole after finishing the quest in La Theine Plateau.
- All other quest rewards are randomly dropped at the end of the
  Carbuncle Prime battle.
- You must wait until the Conquest Tally is updated for the week before
  you can repeat this quest.

The final fight can be duoed by two well geared Summoners. The strategy
is as follows:

- 1. Defeat the Carbuncles and Celestial Avatars up until the 3
  Celestial Avatars pop.
- 2. Defeat two of the three Celestial Avatars.
- 3. Bring the last Celestial Avatar down to about 10% without using
  Blood Pact: Rages.
- 4. At this point, one Summoner should Astral Flow and use Alexander.
- 5. After Alexander is finished, quickly siphon more MP while the other
  Summoner kills the last Celestial Avatar using Avatar melee only.
- 6. When the 5 Carbuncle Primes spawn, each Summoner should take one
  and kill it with a Blood Pact.
- 7. This leaves 3 Carbuncle Primes left and removes the danger of the
  Searing Light that they spam. Killing the rest is not a challenge.

  Prepare for frustration.
  - It may be the case that he's not stuck and is waiting for the player
    positions around him to be perfect, but he looks stuck.
- His first stop will be on the bridge. He will fish up at least one
  Notorious Monster. Kill it for him.

whatever strong AoE damage spells you'd like. If you bring whm sub you
can use that to cast cure on the NPC in order to keep them alive. This
is the quickest basic solution. Another alternative if at 99 is to use
the Trust system, specifically Valaineral and his need of using Uriel

kill them in one shot else he won't engage properly.

- As soon as you zone in you will receive a cutscene.
- Once the cutscene is over, an NPC named Wanzo-Unzozo will spawn.
  - Speaking to Wanzo-Unzozo will make him stop running. Talking to him
    again will make him continue. He will aggro almost everything in the
    zone.
  - Pay attention to Wanzo-Unzozo HP, if it gets too low he will aggro
    any undead inside. He can be cured to prevent this.
  - Just like monsters, Wanzo-Unzozo can run through the Banishing Gate
    so be sure to stop him before you open it, or have the Pouch of
    weighted stones.

- Escort Wanzo-Unzozo until he stops on his own. Quickly talk to him to
  receive Completion certificate (Key Item).
  - If he vanishes before you talk to him you will not get the key item
    and you will have to do this quest over again.

  { title = "Unlocking a Myth", walkthrough = [[This is a category of identical job-specific Quests used to unlock
Mythic Weapon Skills.

Walkthrough

- Talk to Zalsuhm (inside Muckvix's Junk Shop, Lower Jeuno H-9) with a
  Vigil Weapon equipped for a cutscene.
- With the same Vigil weapon equipped in the main hand, fight enemies
  that grant experience points (Extremely Easy Prey or better) and
  perform Weapon Skills and Skillchains.
  - Weapon skills used before starting this quest do not count.
  - You must accumulate 250 Weapon Skill Points.

::* A stand-alone Weapon Skill and opening a Skillchain are both worth
one (1) point.

::* Closing a level 1 Skillchain is worth two (2) points.

::* Closing a level 2 Skillchain is worth three (3) points.

::* Closing a level 3 Skillchain is worth five (5) points.

- Once you have acquired enough Weapon Skill Points, your new Weapon
  Skill will appear under your list of Weapon Skills, but only with your
  Vigil Weapon still equipped.
- Trade your Vigil Weapon to Zalsuhm.
  - He will unlock your new Weapon Skill for use with any weapon and
    return the Vigil Weapon to you.

Notes

- If you trade your Vigil Weapon to Zalsuhm before it is unlocked, he
  will give you a rough gauge on how far along you have progressed:
  - \"I sense only a mote of energy present. You still have a long way to
    go.\"
  - \"I can feel a marked increase in energy compared to when I first
    held it. Keep up the good work.\"
  - \"The energy is threatening to burst forth. It won't be long now.\"
  - \"You've done it! Energy is overflowing as though the floodgates have
    burst open!\"
- Storing a Vigil Weapon with Ghanraam at Aht Urhgan Whitegate (K-10)
  resets its Weapon Skill Points.
- After this quest, the Vigil Weapon can still be used for the Mythic
  Weapon acquisition quests.
  - The Weapon Skill points will not be needed again, so it is okay to
    store it.
- For the first year and a half of implementation from 2007-2008, the
  Vigil Weapons were only obtainable on Floor 100.
- Prior to the July 2014 Version Update, the number of Weapon Skill
  Points required was determined by the number of floors the player
  cleared in Nyzul Isle Investigation.

      Subtle Blow, Primary Stats, Song Spellcasting Time, Cure Potency,
      and certain Resist modifiers (1-5%).
  - Availability of various augment possibilities definitely depends on

  - (With the right mods this could be useful with gear sets especially
    if used in a less important weapon slot, but since TP will be reset

    give party members in range a temporary attack boost and magic
    attack bonus.

  other NMs' health; however, his death may be prolonged due to
  Invincible.
  - A good strategy is to have someone kite Kingslayer Doggvdegg, and

    then the BLMs, then the WARs, then finally fight Kingslayer
    Doggvdegg himself.

- Trade the Elixir to the proper Imp NPC to get a cutscene explaining
  where you need to go to next.

    if you choose incorrectly, you must wait until the next game-day
    (zoning not necessary) and speak with the imps again to figure out
    which imp is the correct one. It may have changed from the previous
    day.
- Examine the ??? in the south-west room (G-9) on the third map (the map
  with the teleporters) for a cutscene.

You must wait one game day after completing Blood of Heroes in order to
start this quest. You must also be on Wings of the Goddess Mission 38
(Note: mission name may be considered a spoiler).

- Speak to Rongelouts N Distaud in Southern San d'Oria (S) (I-9) for a
  cutscene to begin the quest.

  - Survival Guide to Batallia Downs → Cavernous Maw → Batallia
    Downs (S) → zone to Beaucedine Glacier (S) at (E-4) → zone back to
    Batallia Downs (S) is the shortest route distance wise.
  - Survival Guide to Batallia Downs (S) → zone to Beaucedine
    Glacier (S) at (E-4) → zone back to Batallia Downs (S) is the route
    with the least zoning yet further away.
- Examine the Fresh Snowmelt in Batallia Downs (S) at (H-5) for a
  cutscene. (Left hand side before arriving at the Maw.)
- Examine the Fresh Snowmelt again to spawn an NM.

You have 30 minutes to defeat the Mannequin NM named Menechme. You will
be assisted by Excenmille.

- Menechme uses Polearm weaponskills, the most dangerous being Penta
  Thrust.
- Excenmille will occasionally use a skill called Stag's Cry that will
  give himself a temporary attack boost and magic attack bonus.
  Excenmille will also do several unique weaponskills such as Songbird
  Swoop, Gyre Strike, and Stag's Charge that do damage.
- You can win the BC fairly easily by simply curing Excenmille while
  avoiding getting hate on Menechme.

Once Menechme is defeated, examine the Fresh Snowmelt one last time for
a cutscene and your reward.

- If your inventory is full, return to Batallia Downs (S) and examine
  the Fresh Snowmelt again to replay the cutscene and receive your
  reward.

This quest is started automatically after completing the previous quest,
Chasing Shadows.

  you will already be in after finishing the previous quest) for a
  cutscene.
- Examine the Metallic Hodgepodge in Jugner Forest at (F-9) for a
  cutscene. (Near the F-9/G-9 border, in the center of the grid at the
  base of a tree.)
  - From the Planar Rift at (F-9), go SE up the hill
- Zone into Ghelsba Outpost for a cutscene to receive the Orcish
  infiltration kit needed to enter the BC.
  - Quick travel options:
    - Teleport NPC Domenic in Lower Jeuno (J-7) will warp you there for
      750 Gil.
    - The Fort Ghelsba Survival Guide is right next to the zone.
    - Use the Home Point to Yughott Grotto and cast Escape. This will

Tombstones, all statue type mobs. At the start of the battle, you will
be assisted by Excenmille and Maxcimille. Part way though the battle,
Bostillette will join the fray.

- You only need to kill Fangmonger Colossus to win.
- Each Tombstone defeated will weaken the Colossus' damage resistance.
- The Colossus and Tombstones use the weaponskills Seismostomp which
  does damage and Numbing Glare which is a conal paralysis move. They
  all have very slow movement speed and can be easily kited. The enemy
  also seems to respawn a few as the fight continues.
- Kiting the statues while keeping the NPCs cured is a very easy way to
  win this battle, it has been won with three, two, and even one
  character in this manner.

After the battle, examine the Cavernous Maw in Batallia Downs at (H-5)
for a cutscene and to receive your reward.

- This Cavernous Maw must be unlocked in the past before the cutscene
  will play in the present day.
- Quickest way there is to use the Batallia Downs Survival Guide.
- If you have a full inventory at the time of the final cutscene, you
  will be prompted to examine a ??? near the maw in Batallia Downs (S)
  after you make space in your inventory to receive the Griffon Ring.
- You may now speak to Rholont in Southern San d'Oria (S) to learn Trust
  Magic: Excenmille (S) if you possess the Bundle of half-inscribed
  scrolls.

  - Your goal is to sneak up behind the Chocobo NPC and examine it,
    should it see you, it will get spooked and run away.

      checks the surroundings.
    - It will run away if it sees a player. It can see through
      Invisible.

    spooked too many times, it will run away and you will have to lure
    it back with another Gysahl Greens, but you need to supply it.
  - There is a minute cool-down before you can get another chocobo to

- Speak to the Chocobo Tamer (Attohwa) located near the Resistance
  Sapper to purchase supplies and begin the escort.
  - Obtain a minimum of 6 Chocobo Blinkers; use these on the chocobo by
    trading them from your inventory. This will limit its field of
    vision to what is directly in front of it, making it very simple to
    guide around monsters. They seem to be more effective if you walk
    slowly past monsters with your chocobo close to you .
    - Blinkers last 90 seconds. They do not stack with Apples. You will
      see a message in the log when they wear off.
  - Obtain 6 Stamina Apples; Use these on the chocobo when you are not
    nearby monsters. This will cause health to only have around a 10%
    chance to tic down, thus effectively extending your timer and the
    chocobo's health.
    - Stamina apples last 60 seconds. They do not stack with Blinkers.
  - Obtain a minimum of 6 Azouph Greens. Using these on a chocobo raises
    it's health by 5%. You can only use these once every few minutes. If
    you try too often, you will receive a message that your chocobo is
    full.
  - The chocobo's HP gradually decreases during the quest. It is
    important to be quick with this quest.
  - Obtain a few M. Counteragents. There are a few Miasma that will
    appear on the path you need to take and will cause you to lose a lot
    of time if you cannot remove them right away.
- Guide the chocobo to the Repair Crate located at (G-7) avoiding all
  aggro. You can use Silent Oil and Prism Powder on yourself, and your
  chocobo will continue to follow you as normal.
- You will receive a message when the chocobo is close enough and can be

  - If a monster is in line-of-sight of a chocobo, it will run back to
    the last safe spot without monsters.
  - You will know it is running if it says \"Kweh!?\" in the log.
  - If it begins to run, quickly run back to it and interact for it to
    stop.
  - Recommended path: Use a Stamina Apple off the bat. Head straight
    north to the dead and, turn left and walk slightly north of the
    AT-04 Martello > Dark Miasma might be up past the martello > Use a
    Silent Oil here (You can get ambushed here if you do not use an oil,
    and your chocobo will run), turn north and hug the right wall when
    you can, and walk through the rocks > Dark Miasma might be up right
    before the Martello > AT-06 Martello > You will now reach the
    Schnitters. Go to the far wall and turn south, hug the wall and

Notes

- The path to the Repair Trunk and back is a long one. If time is a
  problem, bring along some Azouph Greens to top up the chocobo's HP.
  - Each Azouph Greens gives the chocobo about 5% HP
  - There is a cooldown between feeding the chocobo food.
  - Start feeding the chocobo early on in the route and continue to top
    chocobo as you navigate forwards.

storyline/battle content Voidwatch.

:* Prior to participating in this Quest, players must fulfill the
requirements listed below.

Preparation

- The player must have entered Walk of Echoes via the Veridical Conflux
  in Xarcabard (S) at (H-9) at least once.
  - You will need to be on or past the WotG mission Cait Sith to do
    this.

- Complete each starting city's Voidwatch climb by defeating each of the
  4 Stratum Abyssite tiers' NMs, and obtain the title from the Boss NM
  for that path. To do so, first you'll have to obtain the initial
  starter-city Abyssites from Voidwatch Officers in their respective
  cities:
  - Be sure to return to any Atmacite Refiner to analyze and upgrade
    Abyssite after defeating the monster(s) for each tier below.

  - It may be beneficial for your time to purchase a stack of x99 Phase
    Displacers if you have \"Rhapsody in Mauve\". These greatly weaken
    Voidwatch monster's HP and overall strength. With trusts they are
    not needed on anything lower than Tier IIIs for this first quest and
    fights, however, you will find them useful to have later on.

Walkthrough

Further Preparations:

In order to flag Cait Sith which in turn enables the 2 Veridical Conflux
mentioned below, you will need to complete any 4 past National Quests
(no mix and matching allowed) of the following:

- - San d'Oria (S): Knights of The Iron Ram ➞ Steamed Rams ➞ Gifts of
  the Griffon ➞ Claws of the Griffon.

- - Bastok (S): Republican Legion's Fourth Divison ➞ The Fighting Fourth
  ➞ Better Part of Valor ➞ Fires of Discontent.

- - Windurst (S): The Cobras ➞ Snake on the Plains ➞ The Tigress Stirs ➞
  The Tigress Strikes.

Once a single Quest-line has been completed, touch any of the 3
Cavernous Maws outside Jeuno in the past to get a cutscene for Cait Sith
(Mission). You will receive the title \"Cait Sith's Assistant\" when it
finishes.

- Present day Maws surrounding Jeuno can also be used, provided you have
  unlocked them beforehand.

  - If you have not unlocked these Maws, your only present-day option is
    the randomly-generated zone that you first landed into during the
    previous mission.

Now you will need to travel to Xarcabard (S). You can reach it from this
pathway:

- Batallia Downs (S) ➞ Beaucedine Glacier (S) ➞ Xarcabard (S).
  - The campaign warp to Beaucedine Glacier (S) places you near the
    survival guide if you're missing it.
    - Note that campaign warps are unlocked for each map that you've
      entered before.
    - Warping to Batallia Downs and using the maw to reach Batallia
      Downs (S) puts you near the zone line for Beaucedine Glacier (S)
      if you've never entered the zone before.
  - Be sure to collect the Survival Guide in Beaucedine Glacier (S) and
    the Home Point in Xarcabard (S).
- Once in Xarcabard (S) find the Veridical Conflux located near the Home
  Point for a cutscene and to acquire Kupofried's medallion.
  - if you try to skip this step you will have to return here.

Now travel to Pashhow Marshlands (S) and click on the Veridical Conflux
located near the Pashhow Gate Crystal in (J-9) to start a cutscene.

- Recall-Pashh or the nearby Survival Guide are both convenient options
  to get here.

After you receive the cutscene in Pashhow Marshlands (S) speak with a
Voidwatch Officer in one of the three starting-Nations (past or present)
to receive the Voidwatch alarum.

- - Do not forget the above step, it cannot be done at Jeuno or at any
    other external-cities Voidwatch Officer!

The Quest is now completed, and the next Quest Drafted by the Duchy is
finally flagged.

- Trade 1 Kindred's Crest and the requested item to the Nomad Moogle
  while having 10 merit points.
  - Keep in mind that besides obtaining seals from mobs, two easier ways
    exist to obtain various seals:
    - Spend Login Campaign points - each seal is only 10 points.
    - Shemo can exchange any other type of seal at a 3:1 ratio.
- Speak the the Nomad Moogle again to begin a mini-game.
- When the Nomad Moogle tells you to start, wait ten seconds and then
  select \"Push!\".
  - If you are too fast or slow you get to repeat the process.
  - Each time the Nomad Moogle says \"...\" that counts off one second.
    For example, the fifth \"...\" would be the fifth second into the 10
    seconds timer.
  - The moogle will only count up to 4 seconds, or four \"...\", after the
    fourth one, you will need to keep that pace and count yourself and
    hit Enter at the 10th second.
  - After the screen shows close up's of the participants, it will show
    a close up of you, once the scene changes to the close up of you,
    press enter to \"Push!\"
    - It's about 19 seconds from the time the \"Push!\" dialogue box pops
      up.

Notes

- It is important to know that while the quests viewed on this page have
  a list here, there is no such list inside the games own menus like
  \"voidwatch quests/missions\" anywhere. Instead you will find the quests
  on this page under their respective 'current' or 'completed' menu
  options (just above Records of Eminence); Then choose left or right by
  using the controller or keyboard arrows under the regions: \"Jeuno\" or
  \"Other Areas\" or \"Outlands\" to find them in-game.

- Talk to the Nomad Moogle next to Maat to begin the quest.
- Retrieve a Seasoning Stone, which drops off nearly all level 90+
  regular monsters outside of Abyssea and trade it to the Nomad Moogle.
  - The Seasoning Stone is also available from the Login Campaign for
    only 10 points.
- You will receive Soul gem clasp and access to the level 95 cap fight,
  Beyond Infinity.
  - When Atori-Tutori asks if you are ready, say 'Yes'. This does not
    start the BCNM fight, it merely advances the quest line.
- This quest is now technically completed. Continue to the next quest
  and win the BCNM Beyond Infinity.

- After completing the previous quest, the moogle will give you the
  option to warp to a BCNM.
- You are about to enter a 6-man Battlefield against Atori-Tutori. The
  fight is difficult and there is an optional sidequest that you can do
  for an enfeebling item, see below.
  - The Nomad Moogle will offer to warp you to one of several BC zones
    once you have given him the stone, which you pick does not matter.
  - Players who have previously completed the quest can assist without
    restriction but will not be warped to the BCNM.
- Warp to one of the zones with the rest of your party.
  - There are Home Points outside each destination, if you want to use
    your free teleport to grab ones you haven't already. **Additionally,
    Domenic in Lower Jeuno (J-7) will offer to warp you to any of these
    BCNMs upon completion of this quest.
- Fight and defeat Atori-Tutori.
- If you are defeated, you may enter the fight again by paying 1 Merit
  Point or 5 High Kindred's Crests to the Nomad Moogle.
  - Keep in mind that besides obtaining seals from mobs, two easier ways
    exist to obtain various seals:
    - Spend Login Campaign points - each seal is only 10 points.
    - Shemo can exchange any other type of seal at a 3:1 ratio.
- Warp back and talk to the Nomad Moogle to have your level limit
  increased, and to finish this quest.

Sidequest

- You can get an enfeebling item (Olde Rarab Tail) from Degenhard in
  Bastok Markets (I-10).
  - Degenhard will not accept the trade before flagging the quest Beyond
    Infinity.
    - Select \"But of course!\" as a response to Accept the challenge? to
      flag the quest acceptance.
    - You can then choose \"Nowhere yet\" instead of a destination, and
      have the required conversation with Maat to learn about Degenhard.
  - NOTICE: Once you have accepted the quest Beyond Infinity don't warp
    yet, instead talk to Maat (You may need to talk to him several times
    to get him to bring up 'paying a visit to Degenhard'. If you don't
    do this step you won't be allowed to trade items to Degenhard for an
    Olde Rarab Tail.
- Talk to Degenhard Bastok Markets (I-10) (Home Point #4) at least once
  to hear about the items he wants (otherwise he won't accept them!).
- Trade Degenhard a Seasoning Stone, Fossilized Fang, and Fossilized
  Bone for an Olde Rarab Tail.
  - These items have been available from the Repeat Login Campaign for a
    measly 10 points for years, with no sign that they will be removed.
  - These items also drop off level 90+ monsters in specific zones.
- This item will remove Atori-Tutori's damage taken cap and Terrorize
  him for 2 minutes.
- At least one is recommended for any party to counteract Hundred Fists,
  but it is possible to win without one if you have a sufficiently
  well-geared group.

Fight Strategy

- Trusts are allowed in this fight. You may also bring actual players as
  help IF they completed this quest before but they will need to arrive
  at the burning circle fight location of your choice on their own (they
  can use Domenic to warp there).
- Atori-Tutori has a ~100-damage \"limit\" on the amount of damage he can
  take.
  - This limit is removed while Olde Rarab Tail is active.

Below are strategy notes that do not apply to players with 4 trusts and
1 decently geared Master-lvl player assisting. Such players can proceed
with confidence an skip the below. If you want the fight to go faster
(less than a few min) bring 1 Olde Rarab Tail.

- Strategy 1: Use 3 Low delay melee, capped magic Haste, Enspells, and
  Perfect Defense
  - Enspells do not count towards the damage limit, so they provide a
    very substantial damage bonus especially when used by low delay
    melee. They will overwrite Haste Samba, so don't count on it. You
    can get them through Inferno Howl (with a good skill build) or
    Accession from a Scholar or Red Mage subbing the other.
  - Buff the party with maxed magical Haste (some combination of
    Embrava, Haste, Marches, etc.)
  - Use Perfect Defense (after Inferno Howl if you're doing that)
  - Melee him.
  - This strategy does not require an Olde Rarab Tail.
- Strategy 2: Use a Paladin with Aegis or Ochain and a White Mage
  - With an incredible amount of durability and healing, it is possible
    to survive him.
  - Olde Rarab Tail is recommended but not required for Hundred Fists.
- Strategy 3: Ranged/magic damage and Olde Rarab Tails.
  - Get 6 Ranged/Magic DDs and 2 Olde Rarab Tails
  - Use one of the Olde Rarab Tails.
  - Damage him.
  - 60 seconds after the first, use the second Olde Rarab Tail.
  - Kill him.
  - With Chainspell or excellent mages, it is probably possible to kill
    him using this strategy and only one Olde Rarab Tail.
- Strategy 4: Pet Burn it
  - Get 6 pet jobs (BST preferred) and Dawn Mulsums/Pet Food Eta.
  - Put your pets on it and keep them alive.
  - An Olde Rarab Tail will really speed up the fight.

- Speak to Anastase in Ru'Lude Gardens and choose to partake in his
  quest to receive the Prototype attuner.
- At this point, you must discover four additional Proto-Waypoints
  hidden throughout Vana'diel by using the hints provided upon asking
  Anastase about his prognostications.
- After discovering each Proto-Waypoints, speak to the NPC standing
  nearby to activate teleportation:
  - : Pure white beaches... Clay... Disembowelment...
    - Selbina (G-10) - Talk to Jillia.
  - : A long-necked beast... A chef in search of meat from the beast...
    \"The Old Lady\"...
    - Mhaura (I-8) - Talk to Zurko-Bazurko.
  - : A windmill... A large lake... An island where sand stretches to
    the sky...
    - Rabao (G-8) - Talk to Quwi Orihbhe.
  - : Samurai and ninjas... Pirates... Contraband...
    - Norg (G-7) - Talk to Wistful Bison.
- Once you have spoken to all four NPCs, return to Anastase.

- - It is worth noting that simply flagging the first quest gives you
    the opportunity to flag any of the subsequent teleports and use them
    without completing the quests. So, for instance, once you've flagged
    Researches from the West you can unlock any of the geomagnetic
    founts associated with the subsequent quests like Quicksand caves
    and warp to them.

- Halcyon Rod + Little Worm, Insect Ball

    Gurgling Crab. Also has a chance to not get a bite.
  - The Insect Ball seems to only catch monsters, and will get a No-Bite
    message otherwise.
- S.H. Fishing Rod + Little Worm
  - Will catch Famished Jagil, and a big fish. Most other fish are \"too
    small.\" Any lost catches (even from too small) will lose your bait.
- Comp. Fishing Rod + Worm Lure, Minnow, Sinking Minnow, Shell Bug,
  Little Worm or Insect Ball all work.
- Mithran Fish. Rod + Shell Bug can successfully fish the Delectable
  Orobon.
- Mithran Fish. Rod + Minnow works as well.
- Carbon Fishing Rod + Little Worm, but I hope you are hungry for
  lobster and crab.
- Lu Shang's F. Rod + Fly Lure works.
- Lu Shang's F. Rod + Insect Ball works.
- Halcyon Rod + Minnow works.
  - This combination can also fish up aggressive crab and pugil enemies
    and a Rusted pickaxe key item for the Don't Ever Leaf Me quest.
- Ebisu Fishing Rod + Minnow; got the perfect cut he's looking for on
  1st cast, 1st bite, 1st steak, 1st cut-open. Fished at the watercraft
  dock just north-west of him (north-eastern corner of G-9).
  - Minnow seems quite decent for reeling in the orobon. As I was also
    doing Don't Ever Leaf Me, I continued to fish after completing this
    quest. I got the Rusted pickaxe on the 15th cast: 11x Delectable
    Orobon, 2x Famished Jagil, 1x Malicious Perch, 1x Rusted pickaxe.

  - You do not have to return to Audibert each time you complete one of
    the mini-quests. You may speak with him after all are finished,
    though you will need to interact with him three times.

1.  Speak to Corpo-Vorpo in the Peacekeepers' Coalition. Travel
    Southeast from the Frontier Station in Morimar Basalt Fields and
    Examine the Daunting Emanation at (K-10) between 20:00-4:00 for a
    cutscene.
    Return to Audibert for 400 bayld.
2.  Speak to Barenngo in the Pioneers' Coalition. Travel North from
    Bivouac #1 in Yahse Hunting Grounds, take your first right then
    follow the left wall.
    Examine the Windblown Loam at (J-6) for a cutscene.
    Return to Audibert for 100 bayld.
3.  Speak to Dewalt in the Couriers' Coalition.
    Fish up a Rusted pickaxe in Foret de Hennetiel.
    Note: The quest Flavors of Our Lives blocks progress to acquire the
    Rusted pickaxe, be sure Flavors of Our Lives is not active or you
    will not be able to fish up the Rusted pickaxe.
    Return to Audibert for 700 bayld.

- Fishing right beside the Homepoint with any good fishing rod and any
  bait works well. A cheap rod may break. Carbon Fishing Rod, Halcyon
  Rod, Lu Shang's Fishing Rod etc. will work.
- Insect Ball seemed to be an effective bait to use, aside from
  sometimes being able to fish up an arrowwood log when the same message
  below.
- Rusted pickaxe gives the same fishing message that items normally give
  but is a bit harder to reel in.

:*With max fishing skill, the Rusted pickaxe is very quick to fish up,
like any other item without any noticeable difficulty.

- With low fishing skill, the Rusted pickaxe will sometimes give the
  Monster Reel-In Music instead of normal fishing reel-in music.
- Messages include:
  - \"You feel something pulling at your line.\"
  - \"You have a good feeling about this one!\"
  - \" obtains a Rusted pickaxe!\"

Notes:

- The Rusted pickaxe counts as a fished-up \"rusted\" item, and has been
  tested to qualify for objectives such as Reel In Multiple Rusted
  Objects from RoE and Master Angler (VBD) from Vana'Bout.
- Unlike the partial Bayld awards, this quest doesn't provide any fame

  - You will be asked to choose one of five hats for Tuffle-Buffle to
    wear to trick the Mithra. You must do this five times to complete
    the quest.
  - There are five types of hats:
    - Group 1: Costume: Ahriman cap, Egg helm, Pumpkin head, Snow bunny
      hat, Snowman cap
    - Group 2: Beastman: Goblin coif, Orc helm, Qiqirn hood, Quadav
      barbut, Yagudo Headgear

  - To successfully trick the Mithra, you must choose a type (among the
    list above) you haven't chosen before, and it must be at least two
    places from your previous choice. For example: 1, 3, 5, 2, 4.
  - To be clear, the order you need to pick in refers to the type and
    not the gear's location within the lists above. So you need to chose
    Costume, Heavy, Light, Beastman, Medium without selecting a piece of
    gear you have chosen before.
    - Example: Egg helm, Perle salade, Teal chapeau, Quadav barbut,
      Thaumas hat
      - See the Talk Page for discussion on combinations.
  - If you fail, you must obtain a randomly requested food item from one
    of the five stalls above to try again.
    - Progress is cumulative.
      - Given the fact that you may only use a given type of costume
        once to succeed. It is recommended that you pick in the order of
        option 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 (cumulatively) over and over until
        succeeding.
        - E.g. 1 (succeed) 3 (fail), grab the requested item and start
          back at 3 until it succeeds then move on to 5 and so on.

- Speak to Octavien at Eastern Adoulin (I-8) while on Rune Fencer, He
  will give you the Key Item Runic kinegraver.
- Speak to Gaddiux at the Inventors' Coalition (Western Adoulin (J-10)),
  selecting the option referencing Adoulinian Kelp.
  - Next, Pick the top 2 options. (Ask if the rune stone is still there)
    and (The trial objectives.) until he mention the [] Yahse wildflower
    petal.
- Click the Yahse Wildflower in Yahse Hunting Grounds at (K-7) to
  receive a Yahse wildflower petal.
- In Marjami Ravine, travel to the ??? at the base of the waterfall east
  of Bivouac #2 at (I-8). Use Ignis three times, and then interact with
  the ??? for a cutscene and a Vial of vivid rainbow extract.
  - If you get stuck and don't get the cutscene return to Gaddiux and
    repeat the above until he tells you to first get a Yahse Wildflower
    petal and then head to Marjami.
- Speak to Gaddiux once more, again selecting the option referencing
  Adoulinian Kelp, for another cutscene.
- Speak to Octavien.
- Travel to the secret beach at (J-11) in Foret de Hennetiel (south of
  Bivouac #2) and examine the Bloodstained Glove on the shoreline for a
  cutscene.
- After all party members have watched the cutscene, click the
  Bloodstained Glove once more to spawn Insidio. This cutscene and fight
  can be done as any job, and Trusts are usable.
  - Insidio is an Orobon NM which notably has access to Mayhem Lantern
    (AoE Charm).
    - Upon each usage of Mayhem Lantern, Insidio will gain a significant
      reduction to physical damage taken until it takes nearly no
      physical damage.
  - Party members actively participating in the quest will receive a
    Insidio's extinguished lantern upon defeat. Other members who are
    assisting will receive up to 10,000 Bayld (depending on the size of
    the party), if they have never assisted in this battle before.
  - Strategy for Insidio - If attempting to solo this fight, the easiest
    way to do so is to summon your trusts, preferably those that can
    deal magic damage, your best dps, and those that can Skillchain. Now
    pop Insidio and let your trusts get hate. Once they've gained a
    decent amount of hate, move well out of range of charm AoE. Now sit
    back and watch your trusts do all the work. Using this strategy with
    ilvl 119 gear trusts easily took down NM within 8-10 minutes.
- (Optional) Examine the Bloodstained Glove after defeating Insidio.
- Return to Octavien to complete the quest and receive your reward.

    Arborscent Seed in the Garden Furrow. No fertilizer is required.
  - Date can be harvested as a result of Cactus Stems. No fertilizer is
    required.
  - Moat Carp Creel can be obtained from the Pond Dredger. Using a Super

      You will have the necessary key items, but talking to Traiffeaux
      again will cause the game to try to execute the same cutscene that
      caused the black screen again.
      - Therefore, it is recommended to shutdown and reload the game
        without Windower or Ashita to complete the cutscene.

  \"Fragmenting\" and Pair of fuzzy earmuffs needed to successfully
  participate in the area's reives.

  Mewing Lullaby (as well as casting other enfeebling spells).

This quest has several parts and is rather involved.

- Speak with Nhili Uvolep and she will ask you to go to Dho Gates to
  investigate \"forces of darkness\".
  - Note: You can start this quest as any job, even though Idris can
    only be equipped by Geomancer.
  - Note: If you are working towards an Epeolatry, you will need to
    complete or quit that weapon to begin working on Idris. You will
    lose all materials deposited if you quit, but you will keep your
    Broken rapier hilt key item, and can restart it immediately.
    - However, after completing any part after completing part 1, before
      trading your Nodal Wand to Runje Desaali to begin the next part,
      any part of Quiescence may be started and finished without having
      to restart either quest from the beginning.
- Travel to (F-12) in Dho Gates (Map 1) and examine the Inlet of
  Whispers to receive a Rusted handbell key item.
  - The Inlet of Whispers is surrounded by Apex mobs that agro sound.
  - Waypoint #4 Foret de Hennetiel or HP is near the entrance to Dho
    Gates.
- Return to Nhili Uvolep.
- Speak with Runje Desaali (J-11) in Eastern Adoulin.

Part 1

- Trade 100 High-purity Bayld to Geosuke the cute little Leafkin in
  Eastern Adoulin at (J-10).
  - This can be done cumulatively.
- You will receive the Emblazoned handbell key item.
- Speak with Nhili Uvolep again.
  - You may need to talk twice or until she talks about the bell.
- With your main job set to GEO, examine the \"Water of Whispers\" in Dho
  Gates at (H-7) to enter a battlefield.
  - Foret de Hennetiel Home Point is close to the Dho Gates entrance.
  - This is a one on one against the Bygone Geomancer. Subjob and trusts
    are not available. There is a 15 minute time limit. No key item is
    consumed if you lose. The BCNM may be entered again immediately.
  - She is immune to all damage at first and must be dealt with by
    destroying her luopans that she continuously throws down, up to
    three at a time.
  - Each luopan destroyed will lower her health down by 4%, ultimately
    leaving her at 1% for you to finish off either with a spell or
    physical attack. Meaning that 25 luopans must be destroyed within
    the 15min time limit, destroying more will never kill the fomor.
  - Highly recommend MP and HP restoration items and refresh drinks
    along with use of all abilities available to GEO. She will start
    casting higher tier spells (single target III-IV and -ra II) as her
    health gets lower.
    - You can buy Coalition Ether and Coalition Potion for 2500 bayld
      each from Ujlei Zelekko in the Peacekeepers' Coalition which
      restore 150 MP and 200 HP instantly with no delay between use like
      other meds. Very useful for under geared players or if you just
      feel like spamming -ra.
      - Macro '/item \"Coalition Ether\" '.
      - You may want to macro everything else needed also, spells ja's
        ect.
  - Utilize your knowledge of the elemental wheel to quickly take them
    out, as luopans take severely reduced damage to all elements except
    the element that the element of the spell is weak to, and darkness
    damage.
    - eg: a Geo-Slow luopan will take severely reduced magic damage from
      all elements except wind and darkness, as Indi/Geo-Slow is earth
      aligned and earth is weak to wind.
  - As most do not take diminished magic damage from darkness element,
    using a staff and Cataclysm whenever possible can one shot all of
    the luopans at once except Geo-Languor. If your doing this and get
    Geo-Languor you should cast Aero Fire or Thunder.
  - Another strategy is to set up a Geo-Regen bubble and use Indi-Acumen
    to mitigate the damage from the geomancer fomor and maximize magic
    damage to luopans. Geo-Regen is enough to fully mitigate/regain
    damage dealt by the Bygone Geomancer as she doesn't cast spells very
    quickly.
  - Spamming tier I spells of the appropriate element and shying away
    from -ra spells unless they would deal full damage to 2 or all 3
    luopans will allow you to finish the BCNM in time and not require
    any MP restoration items.
- After the fight, return to Nhili Uvolep to receive your base weapon,
  Nodal Wand I.

  - If you don't have \"Climbing\" it is possible to die, Tractor, and
    Raise twice down from bivouac #5.
- Return to Sylvie. She will offer you the choice of three challenges.
  - Choosing Holla crystal of gales corresponds to a level 109 solo
    fight in La Theine Plateau.
  - Choosing Dem crystal of dunes corresponds to a level 125 solo fight
    in Konschtat Highlands.
  - Choosing the blank option will give you the Mea crystal of flames.
    This corresponds to a level 135 solo Geomancer fight in Tahrongi
    Canyon.

La Theine Plateau Option

- Go to the Crag of Holla (K-8) in La Theine Plateau and check the Ergon
  Locus ??? underneath the Telepoint. You will lose your Holla crystal
  of gales.
- This is a solo fight. You do not need to have Geomancer set on main
  job to participate. Trusts are allowed for the fight, but Fellows are
  not. Buffs and TP will be reset. Time limit on this fight appears to
  be 5-10 minutes.
- Your enemy for this fight is Otherworldly Rimester, a Ghost.
  - BRD job, casts Victory March, Magic Finale, Massacre Elegy, Foe
    Requiem VII, Horde Lullaby II.
  - Uses Dark Sphere, Terror Touch, Fear Touch, Ectosmash.
  - Appears particularly weak to Magic Burst damage.
- Upon defeating Otherworldly Rimester you will earn 10000 bayld and
  Pale azure cloth.

Konschtat Highlands Option

- Go to the Crag of Dem (I-6) in Konschtat Highlands and check the Ergon
  Locus ??? underneath the Telepoint. You will lose your Dem crystal of
  dunes.
  - Trusts are allowed in this fight and you do not need to have
    Geomancer set on main job to participate, but Fellows and other
    players are not. The time limit for this fight is 3 minutes.
  - Buffs and TP will be reset.
  - The fight is against Otherworldly Rimester, a Ghost.
- Your reward is a random assortment of 3 of the following items:
  Fiendish Skin, Siren's Hair, Arachne Thread, Khroma Ore and Star
  Sapphire.

Tahrongi Canyon Option

- Go to the Crag of Mea (I-6) in Tahrongi Canyon and check the Ergon
  Locus ??? underneath the Telepoint. You will lose your Mea crystal of
  flames.
- This is a solo fight for Geomancers only. Neither Trusts nor Fellows
  are allowed. Buffs and TP will be reset. The time limit for this fight
  is 3 minutes.

  Dragonfoe Mambo, Magic Finale, Massacre Elegy, Valor Minuet V, Foe
  Requiem VII, *Victory March and perhaps others.
- His TP moves are Dark Sphere, Fear Touch, Ectosmash and Terror Touch.
  Dark Sphere is the most dangerous and the only one that shadows will
  not absorb.
- He appears to have a rotating elemental vulnerability but the pattern
  it follows, if there is a pattern, is currently unknown. Three or four
  tier 3+ nukes hitting his weakness should be enough to kill him. With
  the pattern unknown, this is a heavily luck based fight. When you hit
  a weakness I suggest immediately following up with another nuke of the
  same element. Often this will also do full damage.
  - A well geared GEO will nuke it's weak element for 8,000+ dmg with a
    Tier 3 nuke, resulting in around 80% of it's HP in damage.
- Your reward is 1 Codex of Etchings and a random assortment of 10 of
  the following items: Fiendish Skin, Siren's Hair, Arachne Thread,
  Khroma Ore and Star Sapphire.
- If you fail you must return to Sylvie for a new Mea crystal of flames.
  You can retry as often as you want until you win.

Finishing Up

- Return to Sylvie. You will obtain Treatise on azimuth clothcraft.
- Talk to Wescolina (H-7).
- Talk to Helina (H-9), located inside the Weaver's Guild in Selbina.
- Wait until the next game day, then talk to Helina for your reward:
  15000 XP and Azimuth Coat.
- To repeat the quest fight after successful completion, speak to Sylvie
  to receive a new Key Item. She likely gives a new KI once per Earth
  day, or once per Conquest Tally.

For the Rest of the Set

- Speak to Helina in Selbina to commission additional armor pieces.
- You have the option to either bring certain materials to her, or an
  amount of H-P Bayld.
  - If you have completed Part 1 of Saved by the Bell (Ergon Weapon
    Quest), Helina will only ask for either a single Dragua's Scale or
    half as many H-P Bayld (rounded down).
- After turning in the items to her for a piece, you are given a
  temporary key item order slip. Return the following game day to claim
  your armor and start your next piece.

This Quest does not appear in the quest log like normal quests do, as it
is run though Records of Eminence.

- Talk to Ploh Trishbahk (K-9) after obtaining the Golden Shovel Cordon
  Key Item for a short cutscene to begin the quest.
  - Obtaining the Golden Shovel will grant you the title Contributer
    from the Shadows.
- Set the The Ygnas Directive 1 Records of Eminence Objective.
  - Quests → Objective List → Other → RoE Quests 2 → The Ygnas Directive
    1
- Head to Rala Waterways and talk to Chalvava at (F-11) for a cutscene.
  - The best way there is from the Western Adoulin (Near the Mog House)
    entrance at (I/J-12).
- Return to Ploh Trishbahk for a short cutscene which completes the
  Records of Eminence Objective and opens up the second Objective.

- Set the The Ygnas Directive 2 Records of Eminence Objective.
  - Quests → Objective List → Other → RoE Quests 2 → The Ygnas Directive
    2
- Check the Mischief Marker in Western Adoulin at (J-11) to trigger a
  short cutscene with Tuffle-Buffle and Musto-Rusto.
  - The best way there is from either the Inventor's Coalition or Mog
    House warps.
- Speak with Virsaint at (H-8) (near the Platea Triumphus) for a
  cutscene.
- Return to Ploh Trishbahk for a cutscene which completes the Records of
  Eminence Objective.

- Wait a game day after completion of the previous objective.
- Speak with Ploh Trishbahk for a cutscene which opens up the third
  Objective.
- Set the The Ygnas Directive 3 Records of Eminence Objective.
  - Quests → Objective List → Other → RoE Quests 2 → The Ygnas Directive
    3
- Speak with Roskin (near the Statue of the Goddess) for a cutscene,
  where he will ask for Copse Candy
  - Copse Candy can be obtained for 10,000 bayld after unlocking its
    purchase from Runje Desaali.
  - To unlock with Runje Desaali decline the initial offer of selling it
    to you for 100,000 bayld, she will offer to sell it to you for
    10,000 bayld in exchange for a Jungle Nectar, which is sold by
    Soupox in Leafallia.
    - It may be necessary to ask her \"What's up with the leafkin\" to get
      the CS.
    - You don't have to decline the offer; even if you accept it, you
      will still be asked to retrieve the Nectar for a discount.
  - Note: Copse Candy obtained through the Login Campaign will be stolen
    in an amusing cutscene until you get the nectar for Runje.
- Trade Roskin the Copse Candy for a cutscene.
  - You may be required to buy multiple candies because there is a
    chance for the candy to be stolen, should this happen, obtain
    another Copse Candy and give it to Roskin for the continuing
    cutscene.
- Return to Ploh Trishbahk for a cutscene which completes the Records of
  Eminence Objective, rewards you with [] Delegate's Cuffs, and opens up
  the fourth Objective.

- Set the The Ygnas Directive 4 Records of Eminence Objective.
  - Quests → Objective List → Other → RoE Quests 2 → The Ygnas Directive
    4
- Speak with Levil in the Pioneer's Coalition for a cutscene.
  - Speaking with Yocile, \"the young woman at the Cafe des Larmes,\"
    prior will direct you to the Mummer's Coalition, however Levil must
    be spoken to for the quest to continue.
  - The Levil CS may be blocked by another quest where he talks about
    Arciela and Kamihr Drifts. If this is the case you will need to
    speak to Ploh Trishbahk before you can continue.
- Speak with Masad in the Mummer's Coalition for another cutscene.
- Beat Ygnas at the minigame: Boom or Bust to continue. To win, you must
  win 3 rounds. If you lose, speak twice with Masad to try again.
  - Purchasing the Key Item Grunt Heard 'Round the World from Runje
    Desaali for 30,000 Bayld will guarantee victory. This option opens
    up after you lose a total of 3 matches (or 9 losses). (This KI will
    make Ygnas shoot until he busts; thus, your victory is assured if
    you simply stay on your first round.)
  - A suggested tactic is to keep shooting till you bust, in the hopes
    that you get a 5 or 6. This will also give you enough time for Ygnas
    to get to either 10 or 11, at which point he will stay and preform a
    trick on you. After he has used his trick, he most likely will stay,
    at which point you can trick a high card onto him in the hopes of
    busting him. Since he can no longer trick you back, you either both
    bust, or he busts and you win. This is a reliable way to win.
  - The easiest way is to roll once then stay 9 times then go buy the
    key item from Runje Desaali because the game has a lot of menus and
    losses. Select the bottom option to buy it in the menu then return
    to Masad, roll once then stay 3 times again to win or use the below
    table if you want to play the game.

    

        {| class=\"wikitable\"

|

- Each round is played by either \"shooting\", \"staying\", using a trick,
  or folding.
- Shooting increases your roll in the same manner that a Corsair's
  Phantom Roll works.
  - Just like with Corsair's rolls, getting more than 11 total will
    cause you to \"bust\", and thus lose the round.
- Staying closes the round for you.
  - Either play may stay while the other player may continue.
  - When both players stay, the round ends and whoever has the highest
    number closest to 11 wins.
- Using a trick does one of three things:
  - You may only use one trick per round.
  - Peeking lets you look at one roll of the opponent.
    - This seems pretty pointless as you can not swap or use crooked
      after this.
  - Swapping lets you change one of your rolls for one of the
    opponent's.
    - Useful if you bust to then switch a roll in the hopes of lowering
      your total or causing the opponent to bust.
    - Alternatively if you have gone several rounds with one high roll
      and several low then you can exchange your high roll to cause the
      opponent to bust.
  - Crooked cards forces your opponent to reroll a roll of your choice.
    - Useful for attempting the cause the opponent to bust without
      messing with your rolls.
- Folding ends the round in a loss.

- Trusts may be called once inside. You may Party with others if they
  have completed or are on The Ygnas Directive 6.
- You'll fight alongside Ygnas and Nashu. If either are defeated, you
  will lose. The NPCs are very durable. They have extremely high HP and
  MP. If you die and reraise mid-battle, they will be able to hold out
  while you recover.

  and erase on himself as well as cures.
- Ygnas will constantly attack one target after the next. Is recommended
  to assist him (/as ) and the target he is after.
- Sleep is highly recommended. All NMs are resistant to light based
  sleeps, but are susceptible to dark based sleeps but Nashu will stand
  at a distance and cast divine magic including Banishga II which will
  wake slept mobs. Liij-Vok Waaxwane's Benediction will wake slept foes.
- All of the Velkk will use their respective 1 hour abilities, and the
  same TP moves from incursion including Jungle Wallop (AoE Damage,
  Silence, Bind, and Amnesia) from melee Velkk as well as Jungle Hoodoo
  (Earth damage, Paralyze, Plague, and a -50% Curse) from mage velkk..
- Take care while fighting Durs-Vike Deathspell as his Meteor is rapidly
  cast and will tear through your trusts.
- The Velkk all seem to have roughly 50-80k HP depending on the target.
- A tank trust that is able to generate AoE enmity (Amchuchu) or casts
  cures and later uses some JA (such as August) will have hate on the
  Velkk when they awake.

Notes

I'm pretty new and been trying to improved the mission template, adding
a replay cutscenes as well as adding level which should be there but for
some reasons wasn't? I didn't know if it was possible to create a dummy
template to try so I'm not sure if what I put would work as like I said
pretty new to this.
--Niamor (talk) 02:54, 10 October 2016 (UTC)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed \"Level\". Reason: Obsolete.
--Niamor (talk) 16:53, 10 October 2016 (UTC)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing to make it look like the Quest Header, I feel like they should
be similar and would put a more unified style. I personally prefer the
Quest design more than the actual mission one. Thoughts?
--Niamor (talk) 02:06, 15 October 2016 (UTC)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big update, adapted Quest Header to the Mission style one. Need to
decide on a few things before updating template.
Pack or Series?
Should we hide Replay Cutscenes and Requirements if none by default?
Do certain Quests have Replay Cutscenes or only Missions?
The \"No\" in \"Repeatable\" is in italic but not the others? Reasons?
Thank you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

K: In a month or so I will probably be adding Youtube links to all the
Mission/Quest pages, since FFXI The Movie concluded a while ago.
Suggestions:
Hide Replay Cutscenes if none by default. About 30% of quests in the
game do not have cutscenes. People should see at a glance whether there
are or aren't cutscenes, without needing to click on a collapsible menu.
Leave Requirements always visible, otherwise the eye glancing over
Rewards might get confused about the change in position.
Don't italicize Repeatable. I don't know who decided on that.
I'm not sure 500px is enough for the cutscene titles. I plugged in an
example of a longer one, but not all of them are going to look that bad.
I could use the <youtube\> tag to add cutscenes directly to the page,
under the Replay Cutscenes menu. At 500px it is readable just fine, but
the full width of 900px would look even better. Food for thought.

- (Optional) Return to Octavien for additional dialogue.

- Check the Tomato Vantage Point in the Arboretum in Rala Waterways
  (E-10) (closest access is from the entrance near Western Adoulin's Mog
  house) for a cutscene with Jerra Ndala.

      from Yahse Bivouac #1.
  - You must go through a Colonization Reive @ I-7.
  - If you are doing multiple, make sure everyone trades their Ifritite
    to the Molten Rift before spawning the NM.

- Check the Molten Rift again to spawn the NM Staumarth.
  - Fight is Soloable by a 118 RUN/DNC using Trusts. See the Talk page
    for Information.
    - It takes a very long time to kill this as RUN because it resists
      every form of damage except Thunder and it spams Spectral Floe or
      Scouring Spate (up to 30 seconds Terror or removes on piece of
      gear) Recommended to have gear sets made.
  - You do not need to be a Rune Fencer for the fight.
  - The surrounding Apex Efts are non-aggressive.
  - Upon defeating it, you will get the Frost-encrusted flame gem Key
    Item.

  Palace to obtain the Levitation device Key Item.

:*Curio Vendor Moogles sell the Coffer Key for 5,000 gil.

:*If you are in a party, all members will receive the Key Item when one
member opens a coffer.

:** If someone who's in your party but doesn't need the Key Item opens
the coffer, no one will get the Key Item.

:**Advice: You can make a full party, leave 1 person at each blue/yellow
gate control and send others to find the coffer, so long as someone who
needs the Key Item opens the coffer everyone in the same party (not
alliance) will get it. Just make sure to keep everyone who needs it in
the same zone as the coffer or it won't count for them.

- Obtain Doctor Status from any Strange Apparatus and return to the one
  in Fei'Yin.

:*You will not be able to obtain Doctor Status from the apparatus in
Fei'Yin.

::*Once obtained, the status will persist after obtaining it in another
zone and returning.

::* Warning: Don't accidentally trade your items to a Strange Apparatus
in another zone than the one in Fei'Yin for this quest! The Strange
Apparatus of another zone will overload with the items from this quest
an summon a strong elemental to fight you. You will also lose your Green
Chip but if you slay the elemental it has a chance at another Infinity
Core.

:* Optional: If you want to save time for the Omega whistle go visit
Boisterous Jackal in Lower Jeuno (H-7) and speak with him 2 times to
enable the circumstances for Administrator Status in Fei'Yin since your
going there next anyway you can save a trip. Also this status doesn't
seem to expire unlike the 'Doctor Status'.

:*Trade the [] Green Chip and [] Infinity Core to the apparatus in
Fei'Yin.

:* The apparatus will then ask for 38 [] elemental crystal clusters. Any
combination of elements works.

::*Bringing these ahead of time helps as you won't find out until after
trading the chip and core.

:*Trade the stacks of crystal clusters to obtain the Whirring engine Key
Item.

- Return to Mapitoto to get the Levitus key Key Item.

You must zone after completing the previous quest.

- While your main job is Summoner, interact with the House of the Hero
  in Windurst Walls for a cutscene with Carbuncle. He will give you a
  Carbuncle's Tear.
- Speak to Koru-Moru in Windurst Walls at (E-7). He will ask for four
  Astragaloi.
  - Astragalos may be purchased at the Bonecrafting Guild in Windurst
    Woods from Shih Tayuun, but is only restocked if players NPC it to
    the guild.
- Trade Koru-Moru x4 Astragalos.
- He will task you to speak to the following three NPCs in any order:
  - Fuepepe at the east Aurastery building in Windurst Waters (North)
    (L-6).
    - Fuepepe may need to be spoken to several times, and repeat the
      same non-quest related text before giving you the correct text to
      continue the quest.
  - Furakku-Norakku at the east Opistery building in Windurst Waters
    (North) (G-8).
  - Shantotto at her manor in Windurst Walls (K-7).
    - Shantotto could start off several quests. Talk to her until she
      mentions Sunny-Pabonny.
- Speak to Gulmama in Northern San d'Oria at (E-7) to receive an Ice
  Pendulum.
- Head to the Cloister of Frost in Fei'Yin. The closest Home Point is
  #2.
  - If this is your first time visiting Cloister of Frost, follow these
    directions:
    - Enter Fei'Yin via Beaucedine Glacier at (J-4). If you do not want
      to walk, you can use the Unity warp.
    - Using the maps below (click to enlarge), navigate to (G-9) on map
      1 to walk downstairs.
    - Zone into the Cloister of Frost at (I-5) on map 2.

- Trade the Ice Pendulum to the Protocrystal to enter a battlefield.
  - The battle will be against 6 Dryads.
    - Trust Alter-Egos are allowed in this battlefield.
    - If you are a lower level Summoner it may be difficult to solo this
      fight. All six monsters have shared hate.

[Map illustrating the location of the Cloister of Tremors]

- Speak with Juroro to obtain the quest. If you are positive that you
  have the required fame but she is not allowing you to undertake this
  quest, continue speaking with her until her text changes. Once you
  have received the Tuning fork of earth, you can now safely undertake
  the quest.
- Travel to Eastern Altepa Desert and look for the entrance to Quicksand
  Caves at (J-7) (where the level 30+ beetle/antica camp is). This will
  put you at the first map of Quicksand Caves at (L-4). You will need to
  travel to (E-10) of the map, to find a hidden entrance to the Cloister
  of Tremors. The map to the right hand side shows you the map with the
  hidden tunnels, falls and other traps. Be careful to not fall into the
  wrong areas.
  - Preferably, home point to Quicksand Caves #2. If you don't have it
    yet, make sure to grab it on the way.
  - The Unity 125 warp places you within a minute run to the home point.
- Defeat Titan Prime and you will receive Whisper of tremors
- Return to Juroro with the whisper and she will provide several reward
  options including the ability to summon Titan.

Notes

- Up to 6 party members can enter the arena.
- Each party member must have their own Tuning fork of earth.
- Time limit is 30 minutes.
- You can only select one of the rewards Juroro offers at any time.
- You may repeat this quest once per Earth day.
- You can save yourself a lot of time travelling to the Cloister by
  using the Mini Fork of Earth given by the quest Trial-Size Trial by
  Earth. You must be on Summoner as your main job, and obtain the Mini
  Tuning Fork from Ferrol. Trade the fork back to Ferrol, but enter the
  Protocrystal normally. So long as you do not clear the level 20
  version of the BC, you may warp to the Cloister as many times as you
  wish.
- You may also choose to retain the whisper in order to complete the
  requirements for this quest: The Moonlit Path.
  - DON'T turn in the quest if you want to complete The Moonlit Path
